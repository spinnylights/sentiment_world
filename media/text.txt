Eventually, we made our way back to the big house and holed up in a tiny room above the garage. There was a small television there. We watched a movie on it that was an action-thriller about a woman who comes into conflict with a group of eco-terrorists. The eco-terrorists were a strange bunch, thoughâthey were after the protaganist because she let animals do as they pleased, and they thought the things she allowed animals to do harmed the environment. They thought that animals should be tightly controlled or even killed to prevent them from harming the Earth. :????: It was a tense film with a lot of guns and shouting and helicopters and people wearing black clothes and so on.

Often, I feel so uncomfortable at the dissonance between my inner goals, priorities, expectations, and basic perspectives on even the nature of extremely mundane and physical aspects of the world and those presented by the other people around me in our society that I take up the misanthrope's pastime of dreaming about fleeing to remote, little-or-not-at-all-populated locations where I can order my life and external space in line with my internal space without experiencing the constant shear stress that comes from rubbing up against a society that implicitly or explicitly tries to order that space in an alien manner to me and rub those internal characteristics in me that create that shear stress with it out of existence.

The next two lines are spoken again and have the same effect as the lines spoken before them; speaking contributes to a sense of conversation and downplays them as they once again perform a linking function. The "I'm a' tell you later" lines are sung and densely rhymed again, amplifying the line, in which the woman explicitly comes on to Lamar. The image is intense and the emphasis put on it helps to set it up as the anticipatory material for the next section, in which it is developed.

Also, an awesome story from this day: I get very few contributions most of the day as many are too poor to give, but at the very last house I knock on the door of, at 8:58, I find a man with a British accent who listens very attentively to my rap, invites me indoors about three quarters of the way through, and says, "I sure hope you're asking for cash, because I can't vote." I tell him that I am, finish off my rap with the bit about the suggested contribution of a hundred dollars, and he says, "Should I give you a hundred dollars? Should I?...Yeah, I'll give you a hundred bucks." After fetching his credit card, he says, "I love your politics in this country. They're fascinating--a total circus show. There's all this money involved--where I'm from, you just pass out a leaflet with what your candidate believes and that's it." Turns out he's German, but lived in Ireland for years and learned to speak English from a British teacher, then moved to the States. Since he only has a green card, not citizenship, he's eligible to contribute to political campaigns but not vote. He tells me a story about how his girlfriend's parents are hardcore right-wingers because they're Christian and believe abortion is wrong, but since they don't support a lot of Bush's other policies, he did all this reading of scripture, "waded through all this bullshit, y'know"--and made a case to them arguing that they should support the Democrats, which he had just recently sold them on and was stoked about. As I leave, he gives me a Tecate for the road. Absolutely coolest canvasee ever.

I imagine the properties of these dreams come from them being at the very beginning of my sleep, when REM cycles are very short and lacking depth, or from being more like naps than a real period of sleep. Generally, when I wake up from them, I don't feel very tired, and it takes me an hour or two to properly fall asleep for the night. Very strange, in any case!

These beinning-of-thenight WILDs have strange properties compared to my normal dreams, lucid or otherwise. They're usually in black-and-white, take place in my bedroom or sometimes in an empty room in another house, and generally don't feature any DCs. They tend to be rather low in qualityâhighly unstable, short in duration, not particularly vivid, and not particularly in-control. Still, they've been so odd that I've rather enjoyed them, although they usually portend a period of insomnia.
I'm not advocating overediting. Sometimes I hear someone boasting about revising a piece fifty times, as if that alone makes them an amazing artist. Often when I look at the work they produced it seems pretty boring to me. So, I don't think there's any reason to revise a piece just for the sake of it, or because you heard that brilliant and famous so-and-so worked on such-and-such a classic piece for twenty years. Some pieces really need this to be awesome. Other pieces are done very quickly. I'm sure you've also come across an incredible piece only to discover that the artist who made it dashed it off in an hour.

Fittingly, this entire set of circumstances maps, metaphorically, directly onto Kafka's own conception of the relationship between him, the mundane world and the constraints therein, and his writing. Walter Sokel points out that although Kafka was not religious in a traditional or organized sense, his thought has a distinctly religious character when viewed in a broader context:
I recognize that creating art in such a society is in and of itself a form of resistance, as having a public life that explicitly makes aesthetics its ordering principle disseminates that pattern elsewhere, but I fear that my efforts will have as much impact as a drop of water in a sea of oil, separating from the whole to evaporate without having made any lasting change in the solution. It would take another sea to make that change, and I doubt any one person has the ability to create that kind of force without being a sort of explicitizing catalyst for the action of larger societal shifts and trends already in motion under the surface, which I do not see here.

We're in a thrilling time right now. Many barriers have been torn down. Artists are largely free to do what they like--for the most part, no one will tell you that you are breaking any rules. This has resulted in a grand plurality of styles in all artistic media. One artist's work may be radically different from another's, even if they are working in very similar areas.

So, the cost-benefit picture gets complicated. In the past, when I've tried to doggedly pursue one project to its conclusion and push everything else to the margins, I've suffered pretty deeply, to the point of crying multiple times a day, frequent suicidal ideation, depression, etc., unless it was a short-term project. This is something I understandably want to avoid if I can. On the other hand, I derive some of the highest peaks of happiness I can feel from the completion of work I deeply care about, and if I was able to access those feelings more often, I might be more happy in general. My experience points to both immense costs and immense benefits, potentially, which adds up to feelings of ambivalence when I consider the topic.
We started using the cottage as a base to eat and sleep in and stayed in the woods for several days searching for the larger anthill. Eventually, we found it, and it was so large that it actually took some climbing to get around on it! As before, the ants didn't bother us so we could move around as we pleased. We were deeply intrigued and spent a long time looking around and talking about what their larger relationship to the forest might be.

 It's interesting to me how there is actually like serious elementary school style social dynamics at play in all this, like /seriously/, at least with Z+me+Rosie+//Rioux maybe even sort of?like as the mawkish socially awkward kid who is kept out of heart-to-hearts. If I utilize the right frameworks I can get myself to feel almost like I'm seven. It seems sort of out-of-control to me. I'm not sure if it's just because I'm particularly sensitive to those sorts of signals right now or if it's because close group adult social interactions without any larger institution structure just generally have strong parallels to that or if it's because there is some sort of heavy dysfunctionality at play. It may well be all three.

You might realize, once you get them all to do something together, that some of them aren't working very hard at playing their role. Take them aside and work with them until they're doing a stellar job. Put them back with their teammates and see if everything is improved. Maybe they're doing what they need to do just right as it is; maybe they're doing something that would be stellar in a different piece but isn't quite right here. If so, take them aside again and have them try it a different way that's more appropriate for the overall goal of the piece.

"thank you for making the world strange again" says someone to Chris Marker, online
We are sailing rapidly into a brilliant reality, one where the sum total of all human expression is available instantly and almost wholly for free. We could become a stunningly well-educated and erudite species and in some circles this is already happening. Artists-in-training who previously would've had to pony up for a good university degree to get in touch with the canon in their field can now peruse the whole thing on their own with little to no resource barriers at all. Aspiring scientists can obtain textbooks and lecture videos that would have cost them tens of thousands of dollars total in the past. Brilliant artworks produced on tiny scales that would've doomed them to obscurity can be instantly transmitted to millions worldwide. This is a gain for civilization that far outstrips the telegraph. What on Earth are we doing whinging about "piracy." Sticky businessman can take care of their own--the rest of us, meanwhile, can study anything we want to, anytime. We already live in a new wonderful world. Lllllllllllet's foster it!
Sabrina Yassin has slightly low Normalcy, high Standing, slightly low Athleticism, and moderately high Guts. She's a middle-aged VP at a local mid-size tech company and has a social circle consisting mostly of other senior-level professionals, especially fellow businesspeople. She was born in the community she lives in and several of her friends she's been close to since high school. Her interests are somewhat unusual--she follows the teachings in the books of a New Age guru and watches mostly Bollywood films--but she only talks about them if someone else brings up an aspect of them first. She's extroverted and generally dismissive of people she instinctively feels are below her. She's naturally healthy but doesn't get much exercise.

We'll pass into myth and the few human beings left alive will remember us as the twisted Abraxes who made the new world.

essence of Carl's concept: beyond just telling parents of adolescents to "lay off" their children and avoid umbrella parenting, actively encourage them to be supportive of what their children want to do field-wise (art, athletics, academia, etc.) without becoming controlling or manipulative toward their child through that field. this involves not only parents allowing their children to approach that field on their own terms, without detrimental parental involvement through projection, through instance (the parent attempts to supplant the child's goals with their own goals or desires in that field by forcing or coercing their child to follow a path envisioned by them), but also by ensuring that parents have an adequate and current knowledge of the realities of the field in the present day, as parents frequently have an understanding of that field that is surface-level, outdated, biased, or otherwise compromised. furthermore, parents may believe that their knowledge is proficient or prolific, possibly more so than that of their child, such that they believe they "know better" than their children and so feel justified in authoritatively directing their child down a certain path. also, these misunderstandings may give rise to unrealistic expectations that they may hamper their children with through active control of their children or even through imparting those expectations to their children, who may take them as valid. if parents are educationally (as opposed to therapeutically) provided with tools and a framework for understanding the realities of their child's aspirations, parents will be more able to give their children the appropriate support and independence their children need to succeed in fulfilling their long-term goals and desires.
I vacillate between thinking I will live beyond a hundred and die by my own hands before I hit fifty. This is, on the one hand, because I eat well (despite my love of chicken-fried bacon and grossly tall chocolate cakes, I mostly eat like seasoned and broiled fish and Portuguese sausage-and-kale soups and pickled seaweed and stuff), exercise a lot, have a good history of people in my family living to ripe old age, and am favored by the projected increases in life expectancy in the coming century. On the other hand, I am strongly considering buying a gun on the sole basis that I think I would feel much more comfortable and secure if I knew that if I ever really wanted to kill myself, I could without much effort. I also get an urge to jump into the ocean every time I am on a boat so powerful that at times it has moved me to tears. Other things that have moved me to tears: striking visions of glowing celestial turbines and a dark apocalypse forged at my own hands after I attain a strange omnipotence, seen in the third person, during my playwrighting class, removing me from the discussion for a half-hour while I silently weep. Am I a raving lunatic? I guess I am able to like drive a car without incident and whatnot at least.

problems? not going public with information meant they were working in a vacuum; had they had the collaboration of other chemists the problem might have been identified much faster and the chemistry necessary to isolate and understand the synthesis of methylmercury might have come about faster. in epidemiology, much easier to identify the source of a cause than to identify the cause itself; when this was done, the local authorities should have immediately banned the consumption of fish, but because the city was used to relying on the bay for food and the economic factors present in preventing the consumption of fish from the bay were worrisome, they didn't; finally, the pervasive sense of loyalty to Chisso and a lack of desire to harm them prevented the science from being productive until long after conclusive results were reached

When I was a very young calf, my parents put me in a pre-school for young animals. Being very progressive, they enrolled me in an interspecies school, and so I played with the young of many different animals. Of course, this was true of everyone in the school to some degree, but I found myself drawn to a small group of leopards in particular. We became fast friends and soon I was playing with them every day. Sometimes the teachers would need to split us up into groups for an activity, and often they would do this by species, which was my first gentle exposure to a pattern that was to deeply trouble me. I would be separated from my leopard friends and put in a group of elephants where I knew no one well, and had to cobble together satisfying social interaction from vague acquiantences.

 Before long he grew old. He went bald and the ring of white hair around his skull grew down past his shoulders. His beard became long and full and white like a tube full of thick fog. His face became leathery and worn-in with deep dimples and lines around the eyes, and he began to kvetch ceaselessly about his arthritic knees and poor heart. Soon he was too weak to operate his stand. It brought him deep sadness to see the stand sitting inanimate on distant street corner. He wanted to hire someone young to tend the stand for him, but he could not, because he was poor.

Well, if you say "I'll put mine up against any woman's" with regards to IQ, the most obvious interpretation of that seems to me to be that you are claiming as Faine also saw that you feel you could best any woman in an IQ test. I've always heard people use the phrase "I'll put my (x) up against (y category that encompasses x)" to indicate that they have confidence that their (x) will come out on top. But later on you claimed that what you meant was that your IQ "is still high compared to anyone's." Why didn't you just say that at first? Again, the merits of that comment notwithstanding, it just isn't subject to the same definitely obvious interpretation that Faine and I both gave your original comment. You went on to say "We were just talking IQ scores, and a score is a score, so I can be confident of that. As far as real 'intelligence' goes, that can best be measured in a variety of different ways, and of that I'm not always so assertive." But in that case, why do you care about IQ at /all/, if it's not a good standalone measure of real intelligence? Logically you'd see this article and just say "huh, poppycock" to yourself and keep going with your life. Your clarifications seem to redefine your opening statements in a way that vanishes them.

Although it appears true that the social standing of the obviously physically female against the standing of the obviously physical male has evened heavily in the last hundred years or so, there seems to persist an intense bias against femininity as a set of traits or a way of being, a bias that is perhaps at least as strong now as it ever has been. This bias has become more covert in the present era, perhaps, but it seems to have become such because it is enacted largely by rote, out of unconscious habit, as opposed to becoming more covert because it is under mainstream attack.

I don't think anyone thinks you need to give "zombie like words of confirmation to what anyone posts"--there are a bunch of ways you could object to this article that I think would be way more likely to inspire a calm discussion by not encouraging a large group of people (or all people as you've later said) to have some sort of contest or conflict with you. You know, you could critique whether IQ is really a good measure of intelligence (you sort of did that already, I guess, but again it begs the question of why you've said any of the other things you've said). You could debate the validity of sorting people into men and women and saying anything about them that way. You could call into question how this conclusion was arrived at--James Flynn, the man quoted in the article, is a professor of political studies who has done a lot of work concerning IQ, but we are not told how he got his data or given any real confidence that his work has been good, so for all we know it's a bunk study. You could point out that it's an article in the Daily Mail. Are these objections valid and worth making? Maybe, maybe not, but it's safe to say that if you want to object, you have options that don't require challenging all women or people in general to some sort of "IQ-off," which just seems well-designed to make people at best perplexed and at worst infuriated.

To make art, take the present moment and let it fall out of yourself naturally. Don't push or tug it out. You have to disappear for this to happen. In /A Room of One's Own/, Virginia Woolf wrote, "...the mind of an artist, in order to achieve the prodigious effort of freeing whole and entire the work that is in him, must be incandescent, like Shakespeare's mind...There must be no obstacle in it, no foreign matter unconsumed. For though we say that we know nothing about Shakespeare's state of mind, even as we say that, we are saying something about Shakespeare's state of mind. The reason perhaps why we know so little of Shakespeare...is that his grudges and spites and antipathies are hidden from us. We are not held up by some 'revelation' which reminds us of the writer. All desire to protest, to preach, to proclaim an injury, to pay off a score, to make the world the witness of some hardship or grievance was fired out of him and consumed. Therefore his poetry flows from him free and unimpeded." This says a lot as long as you don't worry too much about who Shakespeare was.
You might think of a number of things they could all do together that might work well. Set them up so they're doing one of them, take a picture so you remember how it looks, and then have them do another. Look at all the pictures and see if there's one you like best. If so, go with that one. Maybe you like a few or even all of them equally. If so, think about making a suite! Start with one, polish it until it's finished, and then move on to the next. If all the pieces are still equally good to you, treat them all as components in a larger piece and start over. Hopefully when you're finished you'll have a nice suite of pieces that all work well independently and work even better in tandem.

Greater education would certainly helpfor instance, I wish more people understood that radiation exposure can be reliably measured and is only known to cause pathology beyond certain thresholds, which could ameliorate the increase in abortions, depression, alcoholism, and suicide that is sometimes observed in populations that have been negligibly exposed to radiation from an accident. A better track record of straight talk and sober competence from organizations charged with cleaning up radiation accidents would probably do even more. Its hard to educate people about radiation when theres such widespread distrust of public officials and scientists around the topic, especially considering that such distrust stems in part from real past and present lies and cover-ups. I have particular sympathy for radiation conspiracy theorists and paranoiacstheir fears may be irrational in their intensity, but its hard to blame them.

cold kitchen morning
This relationship is epitomized in the parable of the gatekeeper presented by the prison chaplain, who functions as the closest thing to a bridge between the lower court and the Law possible given their separation; his parable comes from the introductory texts to the Law, indicating that though he has not necessarily read the Law itself he has come closer than anyone else Josef K. encounters, and furthermore Josef K. even gets the sense from him that he might reveal not how to influence the trial, as everyone else does, but how to break out of it&even though he himself [is] part of the court. This is the possibility that the Law itself presents, and though it is not possible for the chaplain to do this given his place in the court his illustration of the way the court functions in relation to the Law is the closest thing Josef K. gets. In the chaplains parable, a man from the country, drawn irresistibly to the Law, attempts to enter and despite being told he cannot at the moment, although it is possible, waits and attempts to enter for the entire rest of his life; this further adds to the conception of the Law as fascinans, as Otto characterizes the object of religious fascination as [alluring] with a potent charm, and the individual has always&the impulse to turn to it (Kafka, 215; Otto, 31). The doorkeeper, though he never forcefully prevents the man from entering, forbids him from doing so and informs him that he, the doorkeeper, is powerful&and [is] only the lowest doorkeeper, telling him of a succession of ever-more powerful doorkeepers that lie in the interior, and the man, intimated by this information and the imposing sight of the doorkeeper, chooses to wait for admittance, which he of course never receives; essentially, he is kept from the Law by the sheer presence of the doorkeeper alone, as he feels compelled to obey the doorkeeper given his apparently unimpeachable power (Kafka, 217-218). Additionally, the chaplain points out to Josef K. that the doorkeeper does not know the interior of the Law, and in fact fears the Law more than the man seeking entrance, as the man wants nothing more than to enter, even after hes been told about the terrifying doorkeepers within, while the doorkeeper has no wish to enter. Furthermore, he cannot have been far into the interior, given that just the third doorkeeper is too much for him to bear (Kafka, 220). It is acknowledged, too, that the doorkeeper cannot shut the gate to the Law as he claims, because the gate to the Law always stands open, and thus he cannot truly prevent entrance to it but only serve as a sort of potent psychological barrier (Kafka, 221-222). Finally, the circumstances of the mans death are worth special attention, as, with the Law as a redemptive numinous force, the man sees his own salvation at the time of his death, though he remains outside the Law; the doorkeeper is unable to see it at all, however, as he is facing the other direction and does not notice the radiance, maintaining as always the strict separation between him, i.e. the court, and the true Law (Kafka, 222). This notably mirrors the circumstances of Josef K.s death, in which he sees a window open like a light flickering on, and a faint human figure appears with arms outstretched that Josef K. immediately signifies as representing, if anything, a friend, a good person, or someone who [cares], and leads him directly to wonder where the judge hed never seen and the high court hed never reached was, immediately before he is killed; this person is thus analogically representative of the Law and its redemptive potential, a position even signified by its visual imagery of being a figure high and removed from the world at large, and Josef K., desirous of reaching it, stretches his hands out to it in the same manner, and it is at this precise moment when he is cut through (Kafka, 230-231).

People are made from a mixture of stars and flowers in all of their states of birth, life, and death.

 When you are at the Rock clocks don't run proper. The clock tower rings whenever it likes and however many times it feels would be unnerving. The right book appears in your hand suddenly and ties you down for hours. Cooked mushrooms appear in the air and similarly stop your progress. People go insane and then ascend out of space permanently. Turkeys just float upwards by default. You cannot predict or understand distance. You just try to get by the best you can and roll with it whenever possible.

When you sit down to make art, you can't let there be any more meaning in it than that.

mercury suspected as cause in '57, but because it was expensive, the scientist that suspected it concluded that it would not be dumped and didn't investigate further; another scientist suspected mercury in '58 and did urine tests and autopsies on victims that showed high concentrations of mercury and also sediment tests showing elevated levels around factory; results reported to committee in 1959 and concluded that mercury in fish and shellfish was the most likely cause; however, arguments over the causal agent persisted for several years, because the causal agent identified linked legal responsibility with Chisso and it was undesirable to damage the reputation or functioning of Chisso due to a sense of loyalty and fealty felt towards the company; also, the procedures to isolate methylmercury and the mechanism by which it is synthesized were not fully understood until 1964

I'm so sad it's come to this. I didn't want this to happen. I just snapped. Suddenly the thing in me that was reminding me about the unpredictability of the future and how I ought to hope for things to improve and whatnot stopped working. Maybe tomorrow I'll wake up and it'll have come back and I guess I'll be happy about that but if it doesn't I guess I'll take solace in dying. I suppose I have no opinion in this matter. I'm just doing what I feel I have to do. As I said, I'm not thinking in logical terms anymore. I've lost that ability.

The word "motet" can be a number of things--it always refers to a type of choral music, but what the characteristics of that type are changes depending on what historical era you're talking about. During the Renaissance, which is when this piece was composed, it usually referred to a polyphonic choral composition, often in imitative counterpoint, using a religious text in Latin. /Spem in alium/ is all of these things.

Kafka, Franz. Wedding Preparations in the Country. Trans. Walter H. Sokel.      
 "Yeah," said Nick. "It's helped me out a lot in dark times. Last term I used to look out my window at it constantly while I was writing papers. I haven't payed as much attention to it this term since like things are going so much better for me."
For the Gnostics the path out of the world to redemption was to gain gnosis, or knowledge; for Kafka it was to write. Sokel touches on this in his description of an instance in an interview between Kafka and Rudolf Steiner, explaining that Kafka asserts to have experienced in literature states (not many) which in [his] opinion are very close to the clairvoyant states described by [Dr. Steiner]&in which [he] felt not only at his own limits, but at the frontiers of the human altogether. Kafka describes his&experiences of writing&in terms customarily reserved for religion (10). He felt called to writing as one might feel called to service of a higher power, and was compelled to estrange himself from&all worldly concernshis job, women, friends, and so onin order to devote himself to an absolute task which feels him as completely as God wants His chosen one to be filled by Him (10). Thus, writing held the position of fascinans for Kafka, upholding one half of that paradigm. The other were exactly those worldly concerns, his obligations to his family, his friends, and his society, that he felt bound by unimpeachably. Kafka writes of his father that when [he] was a child everything [his father] commanded was practically commandment from heaven for [him]. [He] never forget it. It remained the most important means for judging the world; and there [his father] was found wanting utterly&[he] did not adhere to [his] commandments (Wedding Preparations in the Country, 172-73). This disappointment at his fathers simultaneous overarching power and hypocritical contradiction reflects a very similar character to that possessed by the court in The Trial. Kafka's experience of life was one in which the world was a place of intolerable confinement, frustration, disruption, and estrangement, [in which] the constant interruptions with which family, profession, and human relationships in general frustrate his writing&dividing [his life] between the true life away from the world and the false one within it (Sokel, 11-12); in terms of The Trial, one where an insidious web of unimpeachable mundane obligations, the court, keeps him away from redemption, the Law. Walter Benjamin once raised the point that the concept of the laws in Kafka&has mainly a semblance-like character, and that it is in truth only for display (Benjamin, 1250); indeed, they do not indicate laws in the conventional, state-based sense, but rather a larger concept of earthly confinement.

We havent had an acutely virulent pandemic in the Western world since the Spanish flu, and the world hasnt seen another chemical disaster on the scale of Bhopal. On the contrary, we have seen, in the last seventy years, Chernobyl, Fukushima, Mayak, SL-1, Windscale, Three Mile Island, accidents and contamination from nuclear tests like what happened to the /Daigo Fukaryuu Maru/, a host of criticality accidents, and so on. Chemical accidents havent occurred with comparable levels of frequency or intensity. With pandemics, its easier to say that our improved knowledge of disease protects us from another 1918 because it was a relatively long time ago, and although were definitely concerned about the idea of something like a world outbreak of a weaponized virus, such events remain science fiction. On the contrary, Chernobyl happened less than thirty years ago, and Fukushima is ongoing, so we cant say with any confidence that we know enough now to prevent such disasters from happening, or keep them from spiraling out of control once they start.

 After the tic phase ends I rapidly move into a new phase, so rapidly that it took several experiences of this type for me to even notice the pattern. I begin to get the sense that I am wearing myself out--the heavy tic energy begins to pass out of my body and I have the feeling of coming back to the ground. Within a minute of this realization I get the urge to do something I can sink into. Inevitably this ends up being reading--I will look at some source of printed word within arm's reach, feel the impulse to read it, and immediately descend onto it and read it ravenously, motionless, in a continuous stream. This will maybe go on for one or two hours. I read quickly and sometimes I can chew through most of a book in this time.

 As the night cascaded downwards, all the events lining up one after another each unexpected falling pachinko as they do in these contexts, we ended up at a house party, some of Allison's friends, where punk bands played in the kitchen. Aaron, Nick's new boyfriend, had joined us by this point. Nick had previously dated a girl Melissa who threw a chair at him once, got into fits where she said everything he did was just a cheap sham, he hadn't actually read any of the books he liked to talk about and so on and so on. Nick's sweet and this really wasn't at all all right obviously. Aaron seemed like a step up, for sure, but he was sort of beige, he came off like he had a kind of alternative computer programmer personality. He was a dedicated painter but all his paintings were just pastel washes, almost Waldorf school atrium paintings. A bit of a mystery.

Last night, I dreamt that I was in a land that had a lot of shallow canyons; it looked in some ways sort of like a Dr. Seuss book setting, but with normal colors and less outlandish plants. Everything had that kind of twilight purple-essence-ish dream glow about it that sometimes happens in my dreams. At one point, I was in a very large mansion, but we (a small group I was with) went on a large treck outside for much of the dream; I think the idea was that we were traveling far on foot, and had some kind of mission or objective, as usual. Joanna Newsom was there and was a friend of mine; at one point, when we were walking through one of the long, shallow canyons (the main one we walked through, really, or maybe the only one--it had walls that were maybe only about twelve feet high, and everything was covered in a kind of very short grass or maybe moss), she kept walking or ducking into these alcoves in the canyon wall (which was very undulating in the way it was laid out--it would dip in and protrude out and such) in order to write songs. For some reason, she had to be there to do it; she would look up and if I recall correctly some console would appear above her in the alcove or she would be able to interface with some ethereal force in a visible way or something like that, and we'd have to wait around while she wrote the song.

 During the first two years of college I was often tremendously optimistic. The school I went to--Simon's Rock--is an alternate universe where everything is usually glittery and very, very fast. Sometimes you are part of the glitter and you glitter yourself and other times you are thrown about in the glitter and the glitter cuts you. But the glitter is always there. Once I glittered so much that I nearly shot right up to Heaven with so much force as to give all the folks up there a really heavy start when I broke through. Three months later I got cut so bad I nearly died, lying there bleeding out on a cold dark hill near the Fischer Science Center. That's just the way things are there.

7/23/08 -- I walk up to a house with a gigantic American flag in the yard--on a real flagpole--to find that not only the yard but in fact the entire house is the most all-American abode ever; the tablecloth appears hand-knit with a pattern of American flags, every room I can see through the window has a painting of the Revolutionary war, and they even have three color-coordinated umbrellas in the living room--one in red, one in white, and one in blue. I am sad they aren't home.

I'd also say that it's not really worth worrying about too much in advance, aside from knowing that the academics are challenging and high-quality and deciding whether or not that appeals to you, simply because it's really hard to predict how your academic experience in high school will map onto your academic experience at the Rock (or probably any college, really). There are people who pull straight As in high school who fail out of the Rock, and people who barely scrape by in high school only to graduate from the Rock with high honors. There are also people who do well or not well in both. There's even a lot of variance between the academic tone of the Rock and other colleges--there's a well-founded stereotype about Rockers transferring to other schools and then transferring back to the Rock complaining that the academics wherever they went were unsatisfying, but I've also talked to former Rockers who felt unfulfilled at the Rock after a couple years, transferred away, and were much happier at the school they transferred to. It goes on forever.

We have struggled to allow women to be strong, assertive, to lead and take charge, to be working people, to be independent. This struggle is obviously not over; though significant progress has been made we still have not had a female president, the vast majority of business executives, politicians, people in positions of academic power, and so on remain male, women are discriminated against in politics and work, and so on. However, it is a fight we are well aware of, and little attention seems to have been given to help privilege femininity, to recognize feminine modes of being with masculine ones as equally worthy of human life on their own terms.

If in such a world you have true ideas you will be inclined to doubt them because the picture of the mob will make them look false.

the one thing it is possible to do to any discrete object is to modify its emotional impact, by making it more intense, melancholy, thrilling, warm, wet, nauseating, ribbed, monacle-related etc. [ oh dear there is a fractal here: each of those emotions has this quality too--oh, because they are also discrete objects--but it keeps going, with a map formed from the patterns of that whole process having its own fractal--a fractal of fractals!--which has its own fractal--it's a true fractal! ]. taking these actions is what an artist does [ traditional forms of art are attempts to capture very specific points on the most basic map inside of an equally specific spot one step up in the fractal, which amounts to a mode, where things such as visual art, music, aromatherapy, etc. reside--literature exists on the next step up in the fractal, as s system of meaning whose shape is dependent on the shape of the dot below it--language--or perhaps on another level up from that--linguistic art ]

I am interested greatly in the genesis of art. The mysteriousness of the factors that caused an artistic piece to be conceived of and realized, even (or perhaps especially) to the artist, as a topic holds a great draw for me. I have done some exploration of the intersection between the origin of art in the mind and religious feeling, as for instance in my included essay on Kafka, and am interested both in exploring that intersection further and exploring new avenues through which to approach the topic.

 Without saying anything, he turned on one of the stove burners. The fire burned so brightly that everything around it seemed very dark. I leaned as close to it as I could without burning my nose and watched the quivering bright blue line running through the middle of the flames. In the fire, I saw the same patterns I'd seen in glittery nebulae every time I'd seen one on a poster or they'd shown them on TV. I thought about how much larger those nebulae were than the fire on the stove was, and I felt a pang in my stomach, and my eyes watered, and a minute later I felt one tear run down my cheek and into the corner of my mouth.

Eventually, when we were walking around this canyon, I somehow got up over the canyon wall and walked across a rickety wooden bridge that went over the canyon and ended up on a rocky outcropping overlooking a thick forest. At this point, I was close to waking and became vaguely lucid, flew into the air, and began having sex with a sort of nameless woman as "I" fell. I didn't not have the sense of really being myself; rather, both people here seemed to be sort of nameless "insert" characters. I switched perspective between them repeatedly and then woke up. I had a wet dream, unsurprisingly.

Outside of that everything is pretty automatic, even revision, and often that part of myself will generate material without me having given it any sort of structure to play with and I will find myself drawn compulsively to the computer and sometimes will write continuously in a sort of daze until the piece is over, or if it's on the longer side this will happen on and off, but like quite frequently, for a few days. I started writing heavily for the first time in years last November when four poems just like barreled into my thoughts over the course of three days or so with no intention on my part of making that happen, and ever since then that part of myself has been very alive.
 It was miserably/wonderfully late outside, but inside there was no time at all. I lay on the floor and longed to smoke a cigarette indoors, while Karl puttered around the kitchen trying to find ingredients for his new cocktail. "It's really a shame, though," he was saying, "because we don't know anyone with a viola."

I don't think I want to stay here permanently. I've realized that I don't really like medium-sized cities--I seem to like either huge cities or completely rural areas. In large cities I love all the culture I can access in physical space, and in rural areas I love the profusion of plants-and-wild-animals sorts of spaces and the lack of people. Cities of medium size don't have enough interesting culture or plants and wild animals to justify the number of people you have to be nearby all the time it seems. On the bright side there are a couple of people here who're really good to work with-I'm working on a set of pieces with a visual artist in town (text is mine, visuals are hers):

  I think of a person's clothes. They certainly say something about the personality of the person, given they selected their clothes from a grand multitude of available clothes of different sorts, but exactly what is hard to say without coming to know them extremely well. The understanding of them that you form after becoming deeply familiar with them is vastly more specific and intricate than your impressions of them at first sight, such that those impressions seem like examining just the molding of what is ultimately a tremendous castle of great height and astonishing breadth.

1. It really depends on who you fall in with. It's maybe cliquier--or at least more socially fractured--than some other liberal arts schools simply because it attracts a really wide gamut of folks, some of whom probably wouldn't have gone to a liberal arts school otherwise. That said, it's not really like people are necessarily snotty or exclusive in a public way, just that people tend to hang out with other people with whom they have stuff in common and may end up feeling like the other people on campus they don't hang out with are too different from them for them to connect with much socially. Or not--but that definitely seems to me to be a more common feeling at the Rock than is maybe average for small liberal arts schools. Sometimes social groups form that decide that they really actively hate most people who aren't in them, but they don't necessarily go around being that way at other people, and they may be almost invisible or at least harmlessly or even entertainingly inscrutable to you if you're not part of them.

It's interesting to see the differences in how I behave when I give myself a block of free time versus when I'm taking free time while I think I ought to be doing something else. When I give myself free time, I often start by rushing around taking care of all the obligations and tasks and things I need to take care of, so that whatever activity I chose to do I can do without worrying about them. I'm also inclined to pick activities that seem "productive" to me in some way--it's very unlikely that I would decide to just read random articles on my Facebook feed, for example. When I'm taking free time in the midst of an "obligation structure", I act in a much more "id"ish way--I wander Facebook, Twitter, and Wikipedia aimlessly, mostly.

If it doesn't have a lid, we're good. If it does have a lid, and the lid is designed for long-term attachment--say, if it screws or latches on--it becomes a jar, or a can, or so on, even if it has all of the other characteristics of a cup. Such objects are sometimes similar enough that is is possible to "use them as cups"--for instance, you might find a restaurant using Mason jars "in place of cups." I'd be tipped off that they were jars by the ridges near the rim for a lid to screw onto--it's a cup if you can still drink out of it easily with the lid on. A jar with holes poked in the lid is still a jar, because those are too much of a pain to drink from, but if you put a straw in the hole, you are "using the jar as a cup." You still know it's a jar from the screw-on lid. But if the lid is snap-on and has a straw, it's a cup with a lid. Ta-da!

 B. While this division is valid, in that Str. did have a radical change both in outlook and art produced, he was never as much as a naturalist as some have suggested.
 But, as everything cascades downwards, the man in back cruises along towards an ever-more-inevitable victory, one invisible at first but quickly crawling all over the game as it draws to a finish. Soon he bears all his chips off, the end of a steady avalanche. The man in front blinks leans back sllloooow and lets his arms drop. Despite all the millions of routes eroded out by fortune at the instant of each die roll, at the last move he knows in a flash the gleam of promise he saw and followed was pure mirage, unattainable in any universe.

If it has a diameter at the rim smaller than at the base, it's for pouring, not drinking, and so I automatically see it as something other than a cup. This is because its small lip suggests that it is designed as more of a storage vessel than a cup. The first characteristic is vital.

It's really sad, too, that you get along with Timothy so well given all that, even if it's also probably pretty wonderful to have someone you can click with that fantastically. What makes him a great conversationalist may have nothing to do with his capacities as a boyfriend; he could be the smartest and funniest person in the world and, of course, still not be emotionally healthy, but very attractive. He sounds like he'd be a great close friend, really, if he wasn't trying so hard to get into a close relationship with you again. Maybe you could still keep in touch with him in any case, if it isn't too emotionally draining--but if you feel like you're still pretty attached to him and it would be hard to talk to him without (a) him desperately trying to get back together with you and (b) you feeling pulled back and forth between him and your misgivings, it might be best to leave him alone for a while, especially given that you have a life to live that's right in front of you and not in Georgia. That, and if you're mainly worried about hurting him because you care about him and don't want him to feel bad, remember that you can't account for anyone's emotions but your own and you should put your own feelings first. He can (and should!) take care of his own--no matter how warmly you feel towards him. If he genuinely cares for you, he'll understand.

Looking at this Urban Dictionary entry on "at the end of the day," I see that a lot of people have negative feelings about people using common idioms in speech. Now, I recognize that it is good to strive for originality when talking and all that but at the end of the goddamn day idioms serve an important role in language. 
Of course that would intuitively lead me to believe that I should be doing lit primarily--which is a question for me right now for sure. But I find music fascinating too--if my consciousness was only slightly differently-flavored I think I might not write without music at all, and I think this really shows in my writing, even. I will probably continue to revolve around and around in this thought loop for at least a few more years if not decades even.

 Eventually I will begin to feel my attention wander. I will keep reading but it will occur to me that it might be nice to do something else. Following on the heels of this will be the return of physical awareness--I will suddenly feel myself again. During the reading phase I almost feel like a floating point but I'm so focused on what I'm reading and not on myself that I don't consciously register this sense of disembodiment. I only notice it in retrospect. Now that I've really thought through it I will probably start to notice it as it happens. In any case I will then stop reading and stand up, and it will suddenly occur to me that I am completely down. I feel neutral. I can act of my own will again. The thing has run its course.

A lot of the conscious, intentional parts of my process that aren't about setup are about trying to live in ways that stimulates that part of myself. I try to read stuff in the area I'm trying to write in daily--fiction or poetry, usually--just to keep my thoughts in that sort of a rhythm if nothing else. I try to process a lot of other media too so I stay focused on the larger, more essential picture--film is really helpful. I keep a diary and try to write at least something every day. I try to give myself a lot of free time and lee-way, and spend a lot of it alone.

You can put anything you want here, in any state, as long as you are interested in seeing it continually reworked and expanded upon. Have a poem you're not happy with? Toss it into the playscape and let everyone else finish it. A beat you don't want to lay down instruments and vocals for? Toss it into the playscape and watch as ten finished songs emerge. A video you want remixed? A pamphlet you're working on? A plan for an organization? A recipe? A science experiment? An architectural blueprint? A political theory? This is an exposed, wild petri dish--anything put here comes into fascinating, unpredictable life.

use fresh-ground cumin and cardamom! as in, buy whole spices and grind them by hand (you could get them at Man Pasand or Fiesta as well)--the flavor (particularly of the cardamom) will be completely different and /way/ better. if you don't have a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, you can use a coffee grinder. clean it first so you don't get coffee in the pudding--but I wouldn't bother cleaning it afterwards 'cause then your coffee will taste like cumin and cardamom for a little while! you can also make a makeshift mortar and pestle using a sturdy ceramic bowl or teacup (not a mug, it's gotta have sloped sides) and the bottom of the handle of a hammer. split the cardamom pods open and just grind the seeds inside--the pods themselves won't powder. don't use fresh ginger though--it has a different flavor from ground ginger. if you want to make ground ginger, completely dry out thin slices of ginger on a sheet pan in the oven at 150? and then grind (but if you use store bought ginger powder it'll be okay--the cardamom is the biggest deal). roast the spices in a dry frying pan on medium heat, stirring constantly, until they smell very intense (just a few minutes) before adding them to the pudding.

 Almost surprised, I wandered into thinking it all over and gradually found myself remembering a dream I'd had three months ago that I hadn't dwelled on heavily aside from its pleasantness, thinking it was more or less regular weird sex dream fare. I was running from Nazis in the French countryside, always leaving town just at the moment a black-clad agent sauntered into the most exterior café. Near the dream's end I decided to hide out and took work at a dairy farm. Standing in the front of the barn washing out a bucket, the ends of my long white sleeves wet and muddy, Nick strolled into view from the barn's left side. I smiled and waved, as if he was a regular fixture, and he just walked right up and I lay down in the hay pile behind me, cupped my hands around his smooth elbows like birch trunks and tugged. He pulled down my skirt no talking and we fell hazily into it, dark all over me, my hands faint on his suddenly naked back the hay pure bird's nest comfort wrapped warm around each other pillowy quiet like a bear's den.
etiquette the finest
A lot of people socialize by just sort of hanging out and talking in groups in a living room or whatnot, although some folks also like party party, sort of--but generally, again, I think parties at the Rock tend to be more low-key than they might be at other similar schools. People are often into heavy conversation more than anything else as a way to socialize, in large groups or otherwise (and "large" is fairly relative to the size of the school--anything over five or so people can feel pretty large). The campus is usually pretty quiet, more or less. That said, the smallness of campus makes it easy to hang out with people almost constantly if you want to. Most things happen spontaneously and in private.

These costs are not the anything close to the end of the world compared to what we are already gaining right this second.
Counterpoint is a technique of musical composition. When writing contrapuntally (the adverb form of counterpoint--the adjective form is "contrapuntal"), you have a number of distinct, independent voices, or melodies. You strive to keep them independent from one another, but also to make them communicate with another, in order to produce a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts. Imitative counterpoint is a type of counterpoint in which the voices enter at different times and repeat a version of the same melodic pattern, often going on to introduce further variations of that pattern in an elaborate musical conversation.

Of course, you don't have to make one decision and stick with it. You are free to try treating two things as one thing, then try treating them as separate but closely related things, and then try treating them as two totally distinct things, and see how your piece changes as you do this. This sort of experimentation is almost always necessary to find a good structure, I think, because it's very hard to know what everything should be in advance.

8. Standard cows usually have some obvious secondary sexual characteristics, but similar to tails these aren't vital. A cow without an udder or obvious male genitals will still come across as a standard cow to the casual observer; closer inspection will probably suggest that the cow is a steer. However, udders in particular have a strong cow flavor; visual depictions of cows often show them with udders, even in situations where the cow may be intended to be male or at least not specifically female, and adding a cow udder to something gives it strong cow connotations. This may be because of the cow's agricultural role as a milk producer and the heavy influence that has had in the general imagination of cows over the centuries.

AUTHOR: Zack Anderson
I feel generally less inclined to divide the world into dichotomies and take a partisan stance about them. I've always been explicitly against that attitude but I now see many ways in which I nevertheless embraced it when I was slightly younger, and I encounter this more and more as I go along, such that it seems quite possible that I will feel this way all the more in a few years. It's true in both little ways--for instance, I was always pro-cat and anti-dog, and now I feel that there is much to be gained from both--and big ones. Perhaps most notably I was (ironically?) anti-academic during most of my time as an undergraduate, and if anything this was a conviction that deepened over time--by the point of my graduation I was convinced that the entire academic world was hopelessly insular and unable to focus on the most essential and vital aspects of life in any discipline. Now I feel more ambivalent--I haven't necessary acquired the opposite conviction, but I wouldn't embrace that one now with such confidence. In truth it all seems more nuanced--having spent time in the world outside and gotten a sense of how the world generally lacks that focus but displays it in certain avenues here and there, it seems almost banally clear that the same would be true in academia. Looking at my experiences in retrospect and examining contemporary academic output now, I definitely see those patterns, often in places where as a student my attention was too heavily occupied by my general distress to notice them.

Despite this, I was confused about editing for years. I had been told over and over of the virtues of careful editing, and had seen lots of proof of its importance--painters who did dozens of studies for a single painting and made many different versions of it before they decided on one, writers who worked on one short poem for months, composers who revised a piece for decades. Sometimes these pieces were nothing much, if the artist was doing all that editing just because they felt that it was proper to edit, but often they were of thrilling and daunting brilliance. When I made a piece, though, it always looked pretty good to me on first pass. I'd usually go through and touch up a little and then call it done. At the same time, I was mystified by what those brilliant artists did to produce such incredible work.

10. Standard cows are alive or recently dead. The decomposition process quickly begins to degrade the other identifying characteristics of a cow, such that by a few weeks after a cow's death, even if it is undisturbed after that point, we are likely to call it a carcass and not a cow, though we may understand that it once was a cow. If it still looks similar enough to a living cow, we may still refer to it as a cow--a dead cow, probably--but pretty soon we will call it a cow carcass, and calling it a dead cow will feel a bit strange. Life is an important characteristic; if an object has some other strong cow qualities, we are likely to see it as a cow still (though not a standard cow--all artistic depictions of cows fit this model, for instance), but if it is not alive, it can only be recently dead to be standard. Life is the only other characteristic of cows aside from their torso that ties all of their component parts together--a pile of cow parts that is alive and moves as a unit will be seen as a fantastic cow, fit for a legend or a film (like Caroliner the Singing Bull), but without life and a central body we just have some cow parts, not a cow.

The periodic whitewashing that erased it all brought only momentary wistfulness as it made way for a new and clever menagerie of wonder.

Each vague object has a slightly different tuning method. Some of its characteristics can be pushed really far before the object becomes unrecognizable, while others can only be pushed a little bit before the object becomes something else. Let's go through each of the cow's characteristics and examine how they can be tuned to produce a "standard" cow, an unusual cow, and something that is not a cow. If you were starting with a formless object and wanted to push it into cowhood, these would be the things you'd want to keep in mind:
Perhaps combine this with something involving Contra(s)? Clever ambiguity.

I'd love to talk about crit theory with you! As I've said I think you may find its basic approach off-putting out of your training in analytic philosophy--it's concerned with different parts of human experience that lead crit theorists to say all sorts of things that it seems like can't really be said in any meaningful way in an analytic framework. Although of course a lot of crit theory is considered "continental philosophy" and much of its luminaries are or were self-identified or employed as philosophers, I think of it as being more closely related to sociology, academic history, or political science than any philosophical tradition outside of itself. In a lot of ways it's the "reverse image" of mainstream sociology--whereas mainstream sociologists are very concerned with quantity and tend to back up their conclusions with numerical data and scientific work, crit theorists are very concerned with quality and tend to back up their conclusions with experiences and interior observations they've had. Sociology makes itself out to be a kind of science; crit theory makes itself out to be almost a kind of art. It has a literary quality.

Zachary called Rosie to ask her if she wanted to come. She decided that she did, and came over. I decided to make some tea, and started the process right as she arrived, so I made tea for the three of us. Elliot seemed to have wandered off and we didn't know where he was. He came back as I was pouring the tea and decided to make more tea from the once-brewed tea leaves, so he took off again almost right away. Rosie, Zach, and I sat together and drank our tea. Rosie and I took whisky in ours. Elliot came back and had his tea, and two folks whom I didn't know came in for a few minutes. One of them, a tall, blond-haired, REI-style fellow, commented on how I was pouring the whisky precisely, because I was using an 1/8th cup measure, in a cheeky way. Elliot left again soon after they did to tend to his Amy's.
 "A spinner," he had been saying, "is a mathematical object that points in a direction, and when you spin it 360 degrees, it points in a different direction. So think of a clock--imagine one of the hands pointing at the stroke of twelve, and then you hit it and it spins around 360 degrees back to twelve again, and then you hit it to spin it that much again and it ends up pointing in the opposite direction, at six, even though you spun it the same way."

 masculinity seems to propose a strategy in which you address challenges by directly opposing them--when something pushes against you, you push back with greater force so the challenge is dispelled, you make yourself so intimidating that it seems impractical to challenge you to begin with, you grow so much larger than the challenge that it ricochets off you harmlessly, and so on

Much contemporary art shows the weight of these pressures. Artists frequently make work without considering structure at all; they tie together a number of components they like with the sense that the structure will take care of itself. Unfortunately, it rarely does so as well as the artist could if they really tried, and their work ends up being interesting but not deeply moving. In other cases, artists revert back to old conventions, making work that owes too heavily to the style of past greats, so that you cannot help but think of the giant in whose shadow they are standing and how dwarfed by that giant they are. This work is not even interesting, generally.

As a side note, everyone seems to have at least a slightly different opinion about this, so I'd take anything anyone says with a certain grain of salt--it was probably true for them, and you'll probably find people on campus for whom whatever they said seems to be true, but it may not be true for you, in the long run, if you do go.

7/24/08 -- It is pouring rain from Hurricane Dolly and thunder and lightning are everywhere. At the beginning of my turf I canvass a guy who invites me into his home, listens attentively to my rap, and then says he'll contribute ten bucks by credit card. As he's filling out the contribution form, he only writes his first name, "Joe," so I tell him that he also has to supply his last name, at which point he writes "Incognito" after it. I assume he's supplied a fake name, but I don't call him on it, figuring I can just check the name on his credit card when he takes it out of his wallet; upon doing so, though, it turns out that his name is, actually, "Joseph D. Incognito, Jr." He also lends me an umbrella.

There's no right answer to these questions. Instead, they present choices. You are free to decide what you think the correct answer is to any of them, and often it's a number of things at once--for instance, if you decide that the lawn, the street, and the sky should comprise the background landscape, you might want to take the photo in a way that highlights the dog and the house. This will create a connection between the dog and the house that you should want to create for some reason, should you make that decision. If you decide that the lawn is seperate from the street, you might decide that there's no reason to have the street in the photo at all. That will draw more attention to what remains in the photo, which you should have a reason for doing.

I think the idea of "digital property" is just silly anyway. Worth seems to be derived from scarcity--something attains value when many people want some of it and there isn't much to go around. On the digital plane any object can be copied indefinitely, so no scarcity exists. Systems to generate money from such objects do so by introducing artificial scarcity--they must inhibit people from doing the more natural digital action of simply copying and sharing. This is not a new train of thought by any means of course but dang if it isn't awful relevant all the time in this conversation and I think tremendously undersaid.

food cooked and cooled may need to be heated again; when reheating food, do so very quickly (within an hour) to 165 F; right way to do this is on stove burners, in microwave oven, convention oven, or double broiler; don't use anything that will heat food slowly, because it takes too long to pass "danger zone"; stir food to be sure that all parts of it are hot; use metal stem thermometer to check temp.

 The first band we saw was pretty good, really punchy klezmer, a thick-beard clarinetist and a lean tall tuba player trading lead. It was nice and they even got people jumping off the countertops as is proper. But the next band that came on was less ideal--they were a hardcore band basically but determined to be proggishly witty and came off real over-precious. They had some name like Gizzard or Whiskers. I wished they would just play some actual hardcore because they seemed like they might've been actually good at it and as it was the crowd was just standing around now slack-jawed doing nothing. Nick and Aaron had wandered off and I was standing around with Allison's plaid shirt friends whom I didn't really know.

<b>Maribel VerdÃÂº</b> is LucÃÂ­a GascÃÂ³n, a Spanish woman in her mid-30s on extended holiday in Paris. Eldridge falls for her around the beginning of the series, and their relationship lasts for a few episodes, but even after it dissolves with GascÃÂ³n deserting Eldridge for his coldness and distance, they maintain a friendship. GascÃÂ³n pities Eldridge, and frequently tries to draw him out of his shell by inviting him to functions and parties with artists and world travelers. She has a great love of adventure, and will frequently go hiking in the countryside on her own or with close friends; one such hike, the only one she went on with Eldridge, throughout the countryside of South France and organized around the plan of working at and staying on dairy farms, remains one of both of their fondest memories. Despite her residency in Paris, she retains loyalty to Spain and an identity as a Spainiard. She loves the paintings of the Pre-Raphaelites, and Eldridge is always meaning to introduce her to Matthews, occasionally succeeding but never getting them to really hit it off, at least during the first season.

I sort of feel like it's hard for me to properly relax when I give myself free time--my superego is very present and I'll judge myself harshly for doing things that don't seem optimal. On the other hand, it's almost like I relax too much when I take free time "mischeviously"--many of the tasks I commit myself to don't do much to uplift my mood in the long term, even if they're sort of fun while I'm doing them, because the tasks that would uplift my mood more in the long term seem like they would take too much effort.

It can now be seen at last that The Trial functions as a depiction of the feat Kafka bore of one side of the equation, the mysterium tremendum of overpowering confinement, overcoming the fascinans of redemption. Josef K. can never reach the high court and the Law, where he might be acquitted and saved, but instead is surrounded everywhere by the low court, which ultimately kills him. It is only at the moment of his death when he glimpses the spirit of the Law, as does the main from the country in the chaplains parable, but ultimately is unable to reach it, as in Kafka's metaphor of being lead from prison to prison with the hope of and awareness of the possibility of release. In this manner, it offers a unique window into Kafka's spiritual consciousness, his secular artistic Gnosticism, that allows the reader to feel palpably his dilemma; it has been said of Otto that part of the success of Das Heilige rests in the success of his goal not only to describe the numinous but to produce it in his readers (Poland, 175), a skill which Kafka shares in full. In reading The Trial, one fears the court and its deadly potency as much as he.

I'm glad you're so pleased by my bon-bon blueprints! And the sea, for that matter, which I do hold so dear. Sadly, the sweet machinery incorporating my candy proto-empire has still not yet been spun, sugar-like, into action. I came to the conclusion that the composition of the musical portion of my thesis (which is the great bulk of it) was too great a time-suck, and planned to start things off once it was finished, which thankfully should be quite soon (a matter of a few weeks). That said, I am all at the ready; I have my molds, giant restaurant-stock cast aluminum pots, and four pounds of Ecuadorian couverture, and have even completed the test-kitchening and recipe for my first bon-bon, an Orange and Irish Breakfast blend. I went so far as to draft a fancy-shmancy description for it, which currently is as follows:

Imagine that you suddenly end up in an unfortunate alternate dimension. You know nothing about this dimension to start off with, but you pretty quickly realize that everyone in this dimension appears to be playing in a jam band together (drat). It's a pretty limited band in some ways. At first glance, everyone appears to be playing one of roughly two kinds of instruments, and indeed most people in the band will tell you that it only has two instruments, violins and cellos. When you enter this dimension, you are given one of these instruments, and told very quickly that it is either that it is a violin or a cello, before you have really had any time to figure out what that means or even what the hell is going on at all. As it turns out, there are two different sets of established techniques for the two different instruments, and right away, slapdash, while you are still reeling and just trying to figure out how you got into this dimension, the people who told you what instrument you have start teaching you how to play it, based on what they've been taught by or picked up from other people in the band. At first you have little idea what to do with all this--everything in this dimension just seems completely weird ("Why is everyone playing in a jam band, and with just string instruments? What on Earth?" you may ask, which you will learn much later is a heavy academic sort of question)--but pretty quickly you start picking up the basics and can play some rudimentary music. This is nice, in theory, because in this dimension playing music with others is one of the most fundamental forms of communication (it is a jam band, after all) and people have a difficult time listening to what you're saying unless you're play some music with them, particularly in a style they know how to play with.

I have Tourette's. It manifests mildly in me. The vast majority of my tics are motion-based and though noticeable by others not in an obtrusive manner. Additionally when I am in conversation much of my tic energy is naturally channeled into conversational gestures which makes me seem animate but not off-puttingly bizarre. I do have verbal tics but only when I am ticcing hard, and they are never swears or anything obtrusive to say. Instead they are a particular class of words that appeals to that part of my brain. Like any tic they feel immensely satisfying to mechanically produce. "Partridges." "Tartarus." A particularly frequent one is "whopping tar." I say them not as single phrases but in long, rhythmic patterns where the syllables are broken up into distinct units. "Whop-op-op-op-op-op-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whopping tar-whopping tar-tar-tar-tar-tar-tar-whopping tar-tar-tar" I will say very quickly and evenly.

I drive for a few minutes following the GPS and realize it's directing off the road and up a big hill. The hil curves around into a rocky overhang. I realize I've arrived, so I stop the car and get out. There's a chintzy-looking "chalice" made out of gold-colored disco-ball-type material. This is the "Holy Grail", which I'm pleased in a lighthearted way to have found. I take pictures of it and text them to my two friends. They tell me I'm being silly and that I should get going, since they're already twenty minutes down the road. I take the "Holy Grail" with me back to the car and genuinely set off on the next leg of our trip.

I think I will try to grit my teeth and shower and then do Backbone work. I'm close to finishing my whole Javascript study program and then I will be able to do work on my projects which will probably be more fun. I also can test my suspicions about how I'll get more ultimately out of finishing my Backbone work and such and /then/ doing music work and the like than I will if I spend more energy than not on doing music right now. To know whether I'm right or wrong about that will be instructive for the future.

I look around online and discover that the only way to obtain a copy of the score is through a publisher in Switzerland who will ship me a copy of the score in three to six weeks for $60. I don't have sixty dollars to spend on any sort of non-living expenses this month and I could be well into a first draft of my piece by the time the score came in the mail if I did. Fuck that! I look around and realize that the score is on What, for free, and I can download it in two seconds. In the long term, this process will allow me to produce more artwork in my lifetime, simply by shortening time spent waiting on the banal.

There is a lot of variation in the degree to which I respond to my own "executive" desires. Before Wednesday, when I started working for Virginia, I was very doggedly doing work on Backbone, to the point that I wasn't seeing my friends much or anything. Now I guess perhaps I'm out of the swing a bit, since I was working for Virginia a lot and didn't do any programming study for the past few days. I socialized on Saturday, and worked on music and read Zizek all of Sunday.  Today I've mostly read Wikipedia articles on animals and more Zizek.

Pour it into the mixing basin and crush for twelve fucking billion seconds, you fuckhead. Then, re-destroy the basin. Now you have a bunch of basin bits. Add the flower salt and any other spare objects you find lying around your dark, dark chamber. By the way, son, don't forget to speak to Gary. Sleep at an advisable time. Pile up the removed crates and thresh them, along with anything else you've been wanting to thresh. Then you're pretty much done, so admire your hard work and sink in. See you soon, son.

cold, free -- you, me
The world is constantly presenting you with exactly what you need. I don't mean that in some kind of New Age-y bullshit way. It is several times a week that I take a book I feel attracted to off the shelf, open it to a random page, and find immediately the solution to whatever problem I've been turning over habitually at the time. No doubt some part of me already had all the machinery needed to solve that problem built and just needed some kernel of something that it could use--perhaps the one I found was one of millions that could work. The trick I think is setting up your life so you are constantly handing down those sorts of kernels to the rest of yourself. I get them most often from reading, listening to music, talking to people I get along with, being outside--regular things, it's not really that hard, but if I say spend all day on the general internet I don't seem to get much, unless I'm being really dogged in how I go at it. I try to be really, really there for those things, which maybe is part of it--I just stand there and read, or sit and listen to music--I just sit and stare at the speakers if I'm really going at it--if I'm talking to someone and the conversation's good I forget everything else, I won't eat all day--I try to take immense pleasure in the sensory input I get outdoors, I feel like I'm being caressed--
It might be worth defining Married as "in a particular legally or religiously sanctioned partnership or in a partnership deemed by the members to have a weight of that sort" or something to recognize that people who can't get legal and/or religious sanction still sometimes decide that they're married. Obviously whether or not people should define marriage outside of a traditional religious context at all is a subject of debate in the queer community, but it seems like we shouldn't write people who do so out of the picture in any case if this aims to be a neutral sort of glossary.
So, when you make art, don't worry. Just let go. Despite the truth in that quote, you shouldn't worry about whether or not your art is preachy or made in protest or whether or not that's good or bad. Beautiful art can have any quality and much of it preaches and protests. It just does so on its own, with its own life, away from the artist. You can't make art like this if you worry about failing and make the art too much about you or not honest or good enough. If you have those worries as you make your art, and you don't put them aside, they'll come true.

Now, the camper's gotta be huge for this reason: we need a bigger coil. The one I made when I was twelve is, well, one I made when I was twelve. It's like the size of a table. Nikola Tesla himself once built one on top of his laboratory in Colorado Springs that was so large it produced 30-foot-long glowing bolts that shattered surrounding streets and houses and caused neighborhood earthquakes. They kicked him out of town for that--but he didn't have a kickin' chopper.
 "Ooookaaaay," I said, and sighed, and rolled over. I began to closely study the outlet on the wall--the lines on each plug squiggled as if they were pinned inchworms. When I moved my head closer the whole outlet dissolved into flashing black and white paisley. It made me shiver and wriggle with delight, and I closed my eyes. Karl's face appeared, grinning cartoonishly, but his face instantly became a bear's face, and the bear's eyes sparkled with rainbows like an oil slick, and the bear opened his mouth and split into two wholes facing in opposite directions, and his two stuck-out tongues splashed out of his mouthes made of red liquid--I opened my eyes, because it became too much.

Fortunately, it doesn't seem to me like this prejducice extends as far in the opposite direction, although of course I don't have as much experience. I can find leopards now and again that say very cruel things about elephants, but often it seems to me like a logical reaction towards a species that has openly and covertly oppressed them their whole lives. In areas where leopards predominate, I've heard that an elephant can have some trouble, but I think that if we begin treating leopards with respect and kindness this would no longer be the case. It may be a very old pattern, but its structure indicates to me that when it began, we fired first.

2. Standard cows are some combination of brown or black and white. They may be mottled or solid (brown, black, or white) in color. If a cow doesn't have these colors, it's slightly unusual. It might be a real, living cow we could encounter in the world, but it either has strange genetic traits or external forces (like someone with an airbrush, or acid rain) have modified it.

The next line, "oh I rap, baby, how old are you", is spoken by Lamar in the context of the story. He delivers it spoken, deviating from the melodic pattern of the previous lines. In this context, speaking the line both paints a more vivid narrative image and downplays the presence of the lines, which primarily serve as linkage between the images that come before and after them. After this, the next lines are sung in the same pattern. Every first beat has a rhyming word, and each rhyming word has its rhyming syllable on the downbeat with the exception of the last, "babies." The offset rhyme in that line is both an interesting variation and helps to resolve the pattern it concludes. Finally, the combination of singing and dense rhyming amplifies the presence of these lines, which are important as they introduce the verse's central concept.

Yeah, I think with sex it gets the most complicated, or a least it can! The implicitness thing comes into play most heavily in that case for me--I actually draw a really strong line between sexual and non-sexual relationships, sexual relationships are always romantic relationships for me and vice versa, I'm very monogamous, etc. etc., and establishing a romantic relationship for me is always an implicit process. Like, if someone tells me that they want to be in a relationship with me before they've made that implicitly clear to me and I've implicitly responded in kind, I won't hold it against them but unless I'm already sure I want to be with them I instantly won't feel interested in them that way even if I was considering it before. Building a sense of implicit understanding in initiating a romantic relationship is for me a way of building a sense of empathy and trust that's necessary for me to feel good about starting a relationship with someone. Creating an explicit protocol for that is sort of impossible. I can see why some people would want to make that protocol explicitly non-sexual, in that (a) having someone do something with a sexual flavor to you that you don't want them to do can feel bad enough that it doesn't seem worth it to set up a system where it's okay for someone to do something like that even just once as a test and (b) if someone asks me if I want to have sex with them I'm almost sure to refuse if we're not already on those terms through some other means.

Fred Frith was one of the founding members of Henry Cow. He's been a prolific guitarist on his own for decades. You might really enjoy the work he's done since the '80s when he first got involved in the New York Downtown scene. His output is huge and quite varied in style--it's worth exploring in depth to find stuff that particularly appeals to you. I've recommended his album /Speechless/ which I quite like and the awesome John Zorn game pieces album /Xu Feng/ which prominently features his guitar work (along with the guitarist John Schott, whom I don't like solo as much, but who plays wonderfully in that ensemble).

8. Female cows usually have udders--large, roughly spherical structures in-between their back legs with generally two sets of descending thin cylindrical structures around the middle with usually a few inches of space in-between each one, which are the cow's teats. Cows are not the only animals with udders, but theirs have a shape distinct to cows. Bulls are known for having large testicles, in a similar place to a (female) cow's udder, but many bulls are castrated.

Of course, you might also discover that some of them are less beautiful than you thought, or that they would really be more beautiful in an arrangement with some other components. This is a wonderful thing to discover. You can then remove those components to use in some other piece, and they will give the ones that belong room to breathe properly.

On a brighter note (or maybe a much darker one), far, far away from our strife-ridden Earth, at the center of the Milky Way, there is a radio source called Sagittarius A* (pronounced a-star) that is almost certainly the location of our galaxy's central supermassive black hole. There is a small gas cloud, about three times the size of Earth, rapidly approaching it in orbit as you read this, with estimates placing its closest approach sometime between now and a few months from now. It will get within 36 light hours of the black hole's event horizon and may be ripped apart completely by the tidal forces, which would probably lead to much of it being accreted. Metal!! Hopefully we'll learn some cool things about how black holes work and maybe get to watch some mesmerizing grainy astronomy videos.

Checkers has been solved by computing. Some experts have raised the possibility of solving chess, and the general consensus seems to be that with a sufficiently powerful computer it could be done. If a pursuit as artistic and intuitive as chess was be able to be "perfected" through computing, one wonders if, in time, neuro- and computer science could work together to solve music for any given person's brain. Upon hearing their perfect piece, I wonder if someone would feel so elated as to abandon their heavy worries or so crushed at the confrontation that they would despair and wish to die, and I imagine it depends wholly on basic outlook.

I told Rosie that it was sort of sweet of them to say that because I felt like although I didn't necessarily agree exactly it indicated that they were "paying attention." We had a conversation about how I was frustrated that much of my gendered actions seemed lost on the people around me and it was nice that someone was picking up on them at least a titch.

I loved reading your description of Euler's identity! Although I've heard of it before in passing (from one of my friends who is a physicist--the same friend that showed me the murmuration video--who compared it to Maxwell's equations, which he feels similarly about), I had never examined it closely. It's very remarkable! I loved seeing the animated model on the Wikipedia page--it's very easy to see what makes it so incredible, even for a layperson: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ExpIPi.gif .

Notes From Underground
The message is too long.
The religious nature of Kafka's thinking and sensibility becomes clear if we look at one dominant explanation of the etymology of the word religion. According to this etymology, the Latin word religio, originally signified a holding&back, a restraint, or a bond and denoted a sense of absolute obligation and dependence. In Kafka's case, such religio manifests itself as his sense of living under absolute laws which obligated him in his deepest being but remained incomprehensible to his rational understanding. (4)

We then went back into the main house. I went upstairs to use the bathroom and saw myself in the mirror; I had a neat gender hodge-podge look going on. I was wearing heavy eye makeup and pink-lavender lipstick, along with a goatee that went around my mouth. My hair was straight, medium-length, and sticking out like I'd put hairspray in it. It had pale blue, purple, pink, and silver highlights and a lot of glitter. I was wearing an outfit similar to a [url=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1A0LIAcCILM/TPQ1GVsDP7I/AAAAAAAAASs/ykvTqJJtk18/s1600/vuelta+castella.JPG]torero[/url] but with low-waisted paints and no dress shirt or tie, so that my midriff showed.

 When we went to bed that night, Karl and I lay together, my head on his chest, not moving or speaking or sleeping, for a very long time. Our touching skin felt like shifting clay, and I could not tell where the borders between us were at all. It seemed that we grew out of each other, or were one twisting, writhing, severely alive animal. I knew he felt the same thing, and I wanted to actually cry, but I was too far away.

However, I must also note that our conversations of late have brought me excessive joy in spite of everything. We seem to have acquired some of that old sense that drew us together when we first spoke with fervor; when I first began contemplating this message yesterday I intended it to include a strong call to the solidarity we share but we in some ways reaffirmed that last night of our own accord. Furthermore, the manner in which we carried on this morning seemed to me phenemonal and reminiscent of us at the very top of our game. My happiness at this did much to carry me through the day.

Analysis:
Petersson metric
All right, let's do some boundary testing! How vital are each of these characteristics? Going through the list, we can see that none of them are truly vital. If an object has all of the above properties, and any one is removed, we still see it as a cow. It might be a non-standard cow--a shaved cow, a very clean cow, a dyed cow, a sleeping cow, a headless cow, a dead cow, and so on--but still a cow. However, as we continue to remove properties, the object becomes less cow-ish. If it has all of the above characteristics except legs, it's a legless cow, but if it also does not have a body and tail, it's just a cow head, not a cow. There are a lot of things we could remove from the object and still see it as a cow--even if it has no tail, no hair, is green, is quiet, lacks any secondary sexual characteristics, does not smell, has no legs, and is dead, we still see it as a cow, albeit barely. Some of its characteristics seem to be more vital than others--if its body has something other than a sqaureish shape, it's still a cow (maybe a fantastic cow), but if it has no body at all, we really need a lot of other cues to still see it as a cow and not just cow-related. if it had all of the other characteristics--a cow head, legs, tail, hair, color, life, and so on--we would see it as a fantastic, bodiless cow. Life is the most important characteristic here--if the head, legs, and tail are still alive and function as a unit, it's a cow, but if not, it's just cow parts.
It seems like part of the difficulty with that protocol comes from variance in what people take different types of affection to signify. A lot of expressions of physical affection have a sort of irrevocably romantic flavor to me that I know they don't as much to a lot of people I know, which leads to I feel like some sort of sad situations where someone I know will do something physically affectionate to me that I really like and appreciate and am touched by (har), but to reciprocate in kind often feels too scary and heavy to me even if I know they wouldn't feel that way about it. By this protocol, that would be okay--I could just say that explicitly--but it's hard to get away from the feeling that by saying that explicitly to someone I am pushing them away, which I /really/ don't want to do in that situation especially since I feel like they've extended themselves touchingly far in even being willing to be physically affectionate with me with us just being friends. On the same note, if someone does something affectionate to me that does make me viscerally uncomfortable but I know it's meant well and it's not something I'd call morally wrong to do without permission in general, I don't really want to tell that person not to do that because I know they were being nice to me. I know it can take a lot of courage to express affection and I don't want to denigrate an action towards me that was by all accounts really sweet, all the more so because it took guts. I think affection imbalances can really introduce discord into any sort of human interaction, even if both people say they're okay with it--like in this case it can start to feel sad and/or weird after a while if there's something that you like to both give and receive that you give to someone else who says they like receiving it from you but don't feel comfortable giving it to you. It starts to feel like either they're only letting you do that to them for their benefit and you're actually making them uncomfortable by doing it or they're generally less comfortable with you at all than they let on and they just don't want to say so.

Thus, as far as I am concerned, art, as the pursuit that has as its goal direct action and construction within the most fundamental firma of reality, is the most central pursuit of human existence. All other pursuits are reflections or extrapolations of it, acting on higher, peripheral planes that resonate downwards into that most basic emotional firma, but are muddied by the time they get there.

We have done much to ease speciesist prejudice in our society but I hope you will agree that we have a long way to go. This story should not come to you as much of a surprise. In polite, liberal circles, open acknowledgement of such prejudice is heavily frowned upon, but outside such circles, it can openly persist, and even within them it may persist covertly. Children, who are very sensitive to the things the adults around them try to hide, often openly embrace the worse parts of the nature of the adults around them, those parts that still live in those adults but are actively supressed by them.

As you do all of this, keep asking yourself those questions about the components from the last chapter. At any stage of the process, you might realize that one of the components should really be three, or that two components that started at opposite ends of the piece should be in a group together, or any such thing like that. You'll probably group and ungroup and combine and uncombine various components many times. You might take one out, bring it in again later, take it out again, and then bring it in again with some modifications in the final pass. You might even find that two whole pieces that seemed totally different to you when you started should be combined into one, or that a piece you were working on should really be five distinct pieces. Always be open to this kind of re-organizing and experiment vigorously.

We are seeing a common and basic dynamic emerge here--the interaction between the abstract component of the essence (the object's function--easy, immediate drinking) and the sensory component (its shape). As is often the case, the abstract component dominates. What I mean by this is that the abstract component is most central to the object--ultimately, anything is (or can be or serve as) a cup if you can drink from it easily and immediately. The morphological components tell you whether a mystery object you encounter is a cup or not--if it fulfills the characteristics of our list, it's definitely a cup. However, someone can tell you something is a cup, and if you take their word, that tells you that whatever the object is, it's meant to have liquid put in it and then have that liquid consumed right away, even if it doesn't have some or any of the characteristics listed above (although if it has none of them you are probably going to react by saying it's a "weird" or "shitty" cup and not using it, by which you mean that it poorly fulfills the function it has been suggested to have). Similarly, if someone tells you that they are using something as a cup, you know that even though you might usually identify it as something else, it's being used right now to store and quickly consume liquid. And if you see something that looks like a cup, but someone tells you it's a container and puts a lid on it, you'll probably decide it's meant for long-term storage and therefor isn't a cup, even though it has the right morphological properties for one.

These are vital questions to ask. You can decide what is and isn't a component, and what components comprise a group together, and perhaps what groups all go under a certain umbrella, and so on. In fact, I think you have to do this if you want to structure your piece; otherwise, you won't really know what you're working with.

lastly, you don't need a pressure cooker to soften the jackfruit if you don't have one--just cook it with the water on medium-high heat in a thick-walled pot with a lid until soft and mashable (a dutch oven would be ideal if you have one but just use a heavy pot otherwise). keep an eye/nose on it and stir it now and again so it doesn't burn. it should take around 20-25 minutes.

the room was filled with soldiers/police and terrorists who rappelled down from air ducts in the high ceiling or came in through doors all around the room; the terrorists came in from the left side and the soldiers/police from the right; the terrorists were dressed in black jumpsuits and wore goggles and covered their faces and the soldiers were dressed in green uniforms; they all carried machine guns and shot at each other across the room; I was hit several times and fell to the floor but was able to get the bullets to slowly pass through me and healed myself, thus narrowly avoiding death; I'm not entirely sure how I did this but I recall closing my eyes and envisioning several orange/blue energetic spinning spiral "vortexes," one for each bullet, that sparkled and flashed, and manipulating them in my thoughts in such a manner as to drive the bullets through me without harming me; by the time I was finished doing this the soldiers and terrorists were gone and I left by getting up on a table against the windows and climbing into an air duct

A while after that, still hiking around in the forest, we found a small one-room cottage. It was empty, but had a few beds, a bathroom, and an endtable that was covered in papers. Examining the papers, we realized that they were the results of someone else's study of the ants, with descriptions of their comings-and-goings and speculations on how long they had been there, the finer points of their behavior, etc. One of the papers had a hand-drawn map with the large anthill we had found as well as an even larger one elsewhere in the forest! The map noted the large beetle mound we'd seen in the clearing and pointed out that the even larger anthill was just inhabited by the ants.

bach's fugue is remarkably energetic and the best example here of traditional counterpoint; both voices function as highly forceful and intriguing melodies alone and function perfectly in tandem. each voice exchanges subjective and motivic content and will typically play role of subject (or subjective material carrier) and countersubject (or countersubjective material carrier), exchanging dominance dynamically and often throughout the piece.
I grabbed the closet one's tie and pulled him into the table and as his forehead hit it he fell in and dissolved into the muddy pool--the next one was easy he stood and I reached in his guts and felt him up and that was that--but then one behind me got me by the arms and the other hit me in the neck and all the life went right out of me sucked up woof like a black vacuum

Zachary and I love to break stuff down together, both by talking and through antics, and really love how well we can do that with each other, but in a lot of ways I really feel like that story just captures the whole essence of our friendship--us breaking stuff down together is something that trans-lates/positions into heavier things for us. If you are traveling into our essence, it's what you see a lot of just before you get to core stuff.

When I got downtown I quickly boarded an apparently stationary bus and entered a new social area--Lillian Dawson was there along with a sort of beach bra type--bleached hair, tight tie-dyed shirt, sunglasses resting on brim of neon baseball cap, shorts, sandals--who was maybe her boyfriend (bizarre idea). There were a few other characters who I didn't really know but were part of the scene. It seems I was crashing at the house of the beach fellow and at one point I got off the bus with him to get some living supplies from the beach shop where he worked. We boarded the bus again which gradually became a solarium open where the back of the bus was. A small yellow wasp landed on my thumb while I was talking and stung me as I noticed it. I said "Fuck!" very loudly, noticed that the group around me seemed a bit embarrassed for me for swearing with such verve amongst lots of people in a public space, and expressed offhand that I maybe shouldn't be swearing so aggressively in public, which they laughed at. My thumb became throbbingly painful and the wasp landed on my head. The center of my forehead began to hurt, but in a more headache fashion--I wondered briefly in the wasp had stung me again but concluded that the effect was psychosomatic.
Okay, let's strategize. How about we set in motion a six-month plan to redistribute the grails. What you say we form a secret police like the FBI but more like a freeform Thailand area? I think I'm embedded in a lattice of discs--you appear to be suspended in a solution of alternates.

Tension is usually talked about in music in the context of "tension and release." It's possible to look at music as essentially the art of creating and releasing tension with sound, and for much of Western music history this was the perspective composers took (many still do, of course, although there are other ways of looking at music).
ppo constructor: 
Femininity seems still to be rendered dismally second-class in comparison to masculinity. Furthermore, little work seems to have been done to liberate abstract femininity from physical femininity as we have worked towards with masculinity; we seem to tie the genuine expression of feminine traits far more heavily to the female body than the expression of male traits. And, though we recognize those feminine traits as largely positive, we value them less than those masculine traits almost universally, and in this way our society is still rabidly patriarchal.

I wasn't diagnosed in childhood precisely because I didn't exhibit the stereotypical signs of ADHD in children, like disobedience or an unwillingness to do schoolwork. As a child I was aware of the deficits in my functioning but I developed coping mechanisms that concealed them pretty effectively from other people. I never really considered that they might be due to ADHD, probably because the stigma surrounding the disorder scared me--I had the idea that people with ADHD were super-rowdy, uncooperative, and prone to outbursts of violence, and I didn't want to tag myself with any of those descriptors. It wasn't until I talked to a close friend of mine from college who had a very similar experience with the disorder to mine and who also was diagnosed as an adult for similar reasons that I realized I should see a psychiatrist.

<b>Sheila Reid</b> is Anne Sally, a Scottish bookstore owner in Paris. She has a great enthusiasm for the poets of the time and is involved on the fringes of the literary society in Paris, being vaguely acquainted with such figures as Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, and even Marcel Duchamp. Eldridge comes to her for conversation, recommendations, and gossip, and likes to stop by her shop when he is puzzled by a case, hoping something she relates will spur inspiration in him. She bakes tremendous pies and sometimes brings them to work with her; Eldridge is always thrilled when presented with a piece of one of her homemade pies when visiting her shop.

Sometimes I think it's perfectly fine, also. I like leapfrogging between topics; it's uncomfortable to work on something you don't feel very invested in at the moment. Sandi Metz describes grittiness in a way as the ability to keep working on a project even when it's uncomfortable; clearly that perserverance is gained by a desire to endure that discomfort and press on. The discomfort doesn't vanish, and I can keep myself constantly comfortable by moving around. If I didn't ever finish anything, this would seem like a tremendous, life-misderecting vice, but I finish projects regularly.

  I am not even sure my reasons for wanting to befriend him are valid. It's possible that what I have seen of him is something of a facade.

But it could easily be true that his inner nature does not line up with his outer nature in any way that could be easily and confidently understood from his outer nature alone.

 1. They make sound. Most notably for me, they moo. They make other sounds, too--calves bawl, bulls bellow, and so on. All of these sounds are unique to cows and sound "cowish" to me. However, if I saw something else make those sounds, I wouldn't assume it was a cow--it might be a person doing a good cow imitation, for instance, or a recording of a cow played through speakers, or whatever. In the absence of any other sensory data, though, if I heard those sounds I'd assume a cow was around.

Standing -- how respected you are in the community. While Normalcy contributes more heavily to social interaction with strangers, Standing also plays a role, and it becomes the dominant stat once your Standing is established in a social interaction. Someone with high standing is a well-known mover and shaker, like a successful businessperson, politician, or celebrity. Someone with low standing is a nobody--a quiet, reclusive person who engages in activities the community take little notice of or actively dislikes. Someone with average Standing has a healthy circle of friends and is engaged in activities that are unimpressive but generally approved of.

In this manner I rode into an opium lounge, but guests of an even more corrupt and downtrodden character than myself had been there before me, for the Secret Service had burnt part of it, and the members of Congress had set fire to the rest, so that between the two of them there was a perfectly good lounge reduced to ashes.

A number of people have mentioned the association between radioactivity in general and nuclear weapons specifically. I think that's part of the dynamic, but definitely not the whole picture. I have a morbid fascination with (ionizing) radiation--I regularly read the Los Alamos National Laboratory's /Review of Criticality Accidents/ like a favorite novel, watch documentary after documentary about Chernobyl, stay up into the night reading technical descriptions of reactor meltdowns, and so on. For me, atomic bombs aren't at the heart of it--they seem far more threatening for their conventional explosive power. When I think of the sick, fascinating fear that radioactivity can inspire, I think of Chernobyl first and foremost, then perhaps the death of Louis Slotin or Cecil Kelley.

was with a group of friends who felt similarly; two of them (C.J. and Gabi) are friends of mine from waking life; we were all members of a kind of underground nonviolent semi-rebellious group who didn't want to adhere to the rule of the regime but didn't want to fight anyone
Zachary and I -- are old and extremely close friends and it shows. We get very involved not only in our own collaborative antics but also in sharing the parts of the world that we access together with each other, particularly because we know few other people who access those parts, and none in quite the way we do. We have heavy differences--he's extroverted and I'm introverted and he's active and I'm passive, and we have different ways of seeing beauty--his much more through action and mine more through perception, it seems like. But it some ways, those differences compliment each other; he feels he can be really up front with me in ways he doesn't feel he can be with other people, and I'm really glad to hear what he says in those veins. I also feel I can be really/pretty up-front with him (it depends--and I'm sure there are things he doesn't say to me, obviously) and sometimes he's interested in me in that way, but often our dynamic tends towards him projecting through me (in a projector sense, not a psych sense)--he almost uses me as a tool to process stuff, since he has a hard time holding everything in his head consciously and I can lay it out for him and draw connections after he's talked through what's going on for him for a while (like just recently tonight, in a way that contains heavy aspects that really deserve their own entry at least, but just briefly to touch on this dynamic--he pointed out that I get joy from giving as something that interested him, and I explained the intricacies of that--not only how I specifically get joy from helping people fulfill desires they have and making sure they're comfortable, but also how I am happy at being part of "the patterns," in our speech (I might individually say the unfolding, or the core essence).and how I feel tension between those two modes, because the utter fulfillment of one folds the other into it as a sub-aspect (having a child vs. being an artist, with being in a close relationship and an artist as the closest possible total merging of the two). He was into that, and asked me to repeat parts of it several times as he lost focus so he could really hold it all together, and make a strong effort to really get where I was coming from, but the weight of the conversation really fell when he was talking about what having a child would mean to him in contrast to some of the stuff he had heard me say about it that he didn't quite grok, and ended up saying that he felt like him and his kid would seem to him to be "biological" equals, in that by having a kid he would really feel that he had sort of put himself into the world apart from him, and then ended up saying that he could die and feel okay knowing that his kid was still in the world (not that he would want to die since he'd want to provide for his kid and keep living his life and all, but it would be okay). I pointed out to him what an extremely heavy thing he had just said, in that he had basically stated that once he had a kid he could die happy and there was nothing else really in the world that would keep him from feeling that way, and said that it sounded like he really really should have a kid. Heavy! When he started thinking about that, he began to cry and cry, and cry. I wanted to hold him, but the best I could do was offer him a hug--I knew he was not only thinking about the gravity of what he had said but also his own father, and we hugged tightly and very close and for a long time. Eventually he decided that he really needed to be alone to feel what was going on for him fully, so I went out into the Franklin common room (and here I am(!/too soonish)) [Later he came out and said that he had talked with Rosie and was going to go on a walk with her, which made me feel glad since I felt that if she was still awake she probably felt sort of neglected, especially with the whole her room for her/Zachary's room for him spiral in Zachary that had earlier separated them].

My friends and I kept going out into the woodsâwe were really interested in what was happening there, moreso than we were in the goings-on in the house. The woods were inhabited by a huge colony of ants, with countless trails and a number of huge mounds at various places. We first got an inkling of this when we found one of their mounds in a clearingâit was like a small hill you could walk around on! It and the clearing were completely covered with ants, but luckily they didn't crawl on us or bother us or anything, so we walked around for a while and examined them and their space with great interest. We were somewhat in awe. We had noticed their trails while walking around the woods and this was our first inkling that they were there in such numbers. Interestingly, we also found a smaller but still very large mound that some black beetles were living in in the same clearing.

There's a lot of misunderstanding about what ADHD really is as a disorder, definitely in the general population but I think even amongst therapists. The hallmark of the disorder is being unable to direct your behavior in certain situations no matter how badly you want to, which might not have anything to do with "acting out". In a way, I think the term "Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder" is misleading--the disorder is more about a deficit in self-direction, where your conscious mind makes frustrated demands at and desperate pleas with the rest of yourself which complies reluctantly if you're lucky and not at all otherwise. There have been countless times I've intended not to buy something and bought it anyway even if I'd be broke afterwards, wanted to leave the house to make it to something on time and sat there staring forlornly at the door as I became abysmally late, and even holed myself up in alone an empty room in an effort to work on something day after day for weeks and gotten almost nothing done (by the time I graduated from college that was my go-to approach for big projects).

A single word puts out a very loud, intense signal. Adding further words complicates the signal while decreasing its volume. However, the volume a single word possesses gives it a different kind of complexity by bringing all of its aspects vividly into play at once. When you look at a whole city, you get a kind of general city essence, but isolating a part of that city might give you a museum, or a theatre, a fight, an orgy, a pound of swans. I am interested in poems that give a rich and detailed signal by collecting enough elements to paint an extremely specific picture but not so many that something like a "general poetic essence" forms instead. I would like people to read my poems not as vague mists of poeticism but precise distillates of a heavily strategic collection of natural elements. I see extremely strong parallels between writing poetry and distilling liquor.

Hey y'all, I'd like to contribute too (Parkside kids yay)! I was diagnosed with ADHD several months ago and it was one of the most revelatory and helpful events of my life. Since going on medication and learning about ways to structure my life as an adult to work with the disorder, I've become astronomically more functional.

The main thing that prompted me to return to this site is that I've been having lots of a strange sort of LD, in an unusual way for me. For about the past month or two or so, I've been having short, very minimal LDs whenever I've gone to bed without being tired enough. Usually they've been via WILD, often on accident. Along with these dreams has come better dream recall in general than I've had for a while, and together they've prompted me to think about dreams a lot more than I have been for the past few years.
The second section opens with transitionary material from "I stood up" to "yep". This material is transitionary both in the narrative (Lamar moves from the living room to the woman's room and they prepare to have sex) and musically, having a fairly simple structure that resembles and thus anticipates the more complex one following it. We get a vocal harmony for the first time, although minimally--the high voice drones on I while the low voice alternates between V and I. There are rhymes on 2 and 4.

<b>Philip Seymoure Hoffman</b> is Eldridge's superior, Mackenzie "Mack" Hamilton, a mid-level member of the secret society. He is jovial, considerably more light-hearted than Eldridge, and doesn't understand why Eldridge is at times as somber as he is. Still, they have complimentary senses of humor, and their extra-professional relationship is primarily maintained by their appreciation of one another's jokes and the shared interests that led them to their field. Little about Hamilton's background is revealed, but it is indicated at various points that he went into this organization following in his father's footsteps. His father is retired, but occasionally makes an appearance to warn Hamilton or Eldridge about an impending danger they weren't aware of; he also maintains a friendship with Eldridge. "Mack" Hamilton has an appreciation for the Resonant Sphere, but isn't nearly as emotional about it as Eldridge, and regards his job more as just a job, albeit a special and interesting one. He is a boatman by hobby, and spends much of his time when not working out sailing on the ocean.

Structure is the webbing that ties the components of a piece together. In art that takes place over time, like literature, music, theater, and film, it has to do with the order the parts of the piece go in and how they relate to one another. In art that stays still, like painting, sculpture, and architecture, it has to do with how the parts of the piece are arranged together in space. In all cases, it's about how the parts relate to one another--where they share material, where they are unique in the piece, and how they change the effect that all the other pieces have.

Before his trial, he was held in solitary confinement for ten months in a six-by-twelve-ft. cell with no window, watched 24 hours a day by guards without even bedding he could use to conceal himself, prevented from sleeping outside of a fixed period, and eventually forced to sleep naked under watch. The U.N. formally accused the U.S. government of treating Manning cruelly and inhumanly after conducting an investigation, although sadly they could not force the government to stop. To this date, Manning is the only one who has been legally accused of wrongdoing in the wake of the information he revealed.

Sadly, in a way, my sense of joy and comfort at this was short-lived. It wasn't long until I started on the long road of adolescence. The further I went along that road and started to consider the wider world and my place in it from a more adult perspective, the more my buried sense of leopardness tried to claw its way to the surface. I would often wake with a jolt of fear from dreams where I looked in a mirror or a puddle and realized I was a leopard. I felt undeniably drawn to the media and objects made for leopards that I had previously avoided with a religious sense of prohibition. Soon I began to perceive myself as having two selves: the elephant self, which was "me," and the leopard self, which begged, pleaded, demanded to become me.

However, the court is not the only omnipresent entity in the text; we also encounter the Law, which the court is supposedly beholden to and exists to uphold, but in fact functions as a barrier to. The Law, when taken separately from the court, epitomizes the other aspect of numinous experience, namely that of the fascinans or element of fascination. Otto writes of this aspect, the ideas and concepts which are the parallels&on the rational side of this non-rational element of fascination are love, mercy, pity, comfort; these are all natural elements of the common psychical life, only they are here thought as absolute and in completeness (Otto, 31). Fascinans is essentially the concept of redemptive religious bliss. The Law has such a transcendental and redemptive character throughout the text, as well as a sometimes overtly religious one, likening it in some ways to the court and setting it completely at odds with it in others; for instance, the painter tells Josef K. that the Law, which [hes] never read&says of course on the one hand an innocent person is to be acquitted; on the other hand it does not say that judges can be influenced, but his experience has been precisely the opposite, and goes on to say that he has never seen a person acquitted and the influence of judges by outside sources is universal in the trials he has witnessed (Kafka, 153). However, he has only witnessed trials in the lower courts, which do not have the ability to grant final acquittals; that power resides only in the highest court, which is totally inaccessible, the painter tells Josef K., to you and me and everyone else. We dont know what things look like up there, and incidentally, we dont want to know (Kafka, 158). This motif of a higher court far in the stratosphere that is free from everything that problematizes the lower court Josef K. is being tried under is repeated continually; Block, the merchant, even tells Josef K. of the great lawyers, [who]&stand incomparably higher in rank above the petty lawyers than those do over the despised shysters, but who are impossible to contact and only take on cases that have already advanced beyond the lower court (Kafka, 179). This higher court appears to present the only path for truly escaping a trial, as it upholds the Law and can grant true acquittals, but the lower court actually functions in opposition to it, and no one in the lower court has ever seen the higher court or evens knows it exists beyond hearsay; in fact, the barrier between the lower court and the higher court, and thus the lower court and the Law, seems impenetrable even in perceptual terms.

However, there are some people who don't fall into either of these camps, and these people are often in a certain kind of trouble. This is because they want to play their instruments differently from how they were taught, and how everyone around them resultantly expects them to play, and this bothers most of the other people in the band greatly because they see those sorts of actions as messing up the music they are trying really hard to make with a bunch of the rest of the band. To a lot of the other people in the band, playing an instrument that way sounds really dissonant and jarring against the music most of everyone else is trying to play, which in the minds of most of the music-makers musses the music for most everyone.

George Zimmerman is acquitted of murder charges after stalking and fatally shooting unarmed Black high school student Trayvon Martin. His defense rested on Florida's 2005 "Stand Your Ground" law, crafted by the state's gun lobby. Although the law has in general doubled the number of homicides ruled justifiable since its passage, It has offered an overwhelmingly unhelpful defense to Black folks in comparison to other racial groups. In cases where a Black defendant shot a white person, there has barely been any increase in acquittals.

"Over the past two years, I have become continually more interested in phenomenology, and have acquired the skill set and knowledge necessary to begin doing real work in it. In order to mature as a phenomenologist, I now need to pursue a more independent project that will give me a sense of what would be required of me as a professional. I started working with a professor in the field at the beginning of the summer, who will oversee the project I have proposed, helping me to understand its relevance to the phenomenological community at large. This will push me in the direction of being able to formulate pertinent questions to explore once I have completed my graduate education."

The last lines are delivered in two voices speaking at octaves. As the line is a quotation, speaking helps to evoke the narrative image while doubling raises the intensity of the lines. The lines also contain the most involved single rhyme pattern of the verse, with eight rhyming syllables in rapid succession. These techniques give the lines a vivid cerebral intensity that distinguishes them from the more emotionally intense quality of previous emphasized lines. By eschewing the more emotional technique of singing and keeping the rhyme scheme focused on a single intricate rhyme pattern instead of carrying the listener forward in a more visceral manner by using a stream of varied rhyme patterns, the listener's attention is drawn aggressively to the content of the text which stands out powerfully. After the last word, there is a loud snare hit and then beat drops out for a second, amplifying the dramatic effect of the line.

We are envisioning the roles as fairly fluid and will probably share work as it comes. I'd be very pleased if this became work I could support myself on, I think.

Okay, so, predictably, that led far away from this and heavily into several intense conversations with Zachary and Rosie that have brought parts of this more strongly into focus, recontextualized parts of it, and all that--Rosie fell asleep in Zachary's bed maybe two hours ago and Zachary hit a thick wall of tiredness in our ensuing heavy conversation that is pulling him into sleep as I write. I'm also exhausted, and given the time it's probably pretty phenomenal that I'm going to bed, in the long run. I'll keep going over this, with the new parts!, when it's time.!

I wanted to follow up about the book I mentioned, Owen Barfield's /Saving the Appearances/, in case you're interested. If you like myth, I think it's a really wonderful read--he does a fascinating job of constructing a model for the ways that people living in mythic cultures tended to look at reality, and how the patterns in myth emerge from those perspectives. He also posits a neat model of how those modes of thought developed gradually into those common today. It adds a unique dimension to reading and thinking about myths, and helps to call attention to some basic assumptions we tend to make about the world today without noticing we're making them.

I just now read your story in /Concisely/ and I thought it was /awesome/! I rarely read any contemporary fiction that I like at all. I'm glad you took the trouble to write it. Stories that deftly make "hideous" sorts of people private and empathetic are always wonderful I think. Often it seems to me like those stories do a far better job of exposing the feelings at the very heart of human life than stories about more placid people (/Notes from Underground/?). Everybody knows what it's like to "think wrong" in some fashion but of course almost no one wants to ever reveal that or even become conscious of feeling that way when it happens.

A first sign of beginning knowledge is the wish to die. This life seems unbearable, another life unattainable. One is no longer ashamed of wanting to die; one asks to be taken out of the old prison cell which one hates and to be brought to a new one which one will learn to hate. But in this wish there also glimmers&faith that during the transport the Lord will perchance pass by, look at the prisoner and say: This one you shall not lock up again.

 I almost laughed, but caught myself. I stood on the very edge of the dock, so I couldn't see any of it, and tried to imagine that I was standing on the surface of the water, and that only the force of my will kept me afloat, and I could drop if I wanted any second.

To ensure that this clarity is not imagined on my part and that I did, in fact, get what you're getting at, here is a summary of my general understanding of the crux of your excerpts: 
As time went on, I got better at supressing the leopardish parts of myself and bringing out the elephantine parts in their place. Even to this day there are aspects of mainstream elephant behavior that I struggle to even understand, let alone enact, but through careful study and practice I was able to present a comprehendably elephantine persona. Through years of mocking and derision, I learned which parts of myself the other elephants saw as leapordish, and used that understanding to bury those parts. As I did this, my peers at school accepted me more and more, until eventually I had a large circle of friends and felt rather popular.

As we test its boundaries, a cow is revealing itself as a vague sensory object. As opposed to a specific sensory object, which has vital sensory components, we know a cow by the rough sum of its sensory parts. Vague objects can be "tuned." Think of a perfectly in-tune instrument; if someone performs the mechanical actions on that instrument necessary to produce a song you know, you'll recognize it as a spot-on rendition of that song. If the instrument is a little bit out-of-tune, you'll still recognize it as that song, but warped. As the instrument is moved further and further out-of-tune, you'll reach a point where you can barely identify the song, and soon after that a point where the song is totally unrecognizable. Vague objects are just like this. Each characteristic is a bit like, say, a tuning peg on a stringed instrument--as we adjust them, the object goes in and out of focus.

I attended this school regularly for a few years and over time picked up a lot from my leopard friends. I learned the songs of leopard cubs, their games, the activities they like, their ways of solving disputes. Sometimes they would lend me some of their clothes if I took an interest, and I must have looked strange to the teachers, an elephant dressed in leopard hat and stockings or something like that, but we were all very young and thought nothing of it. If this did bother the teachers, they gave no sign, and if my parents noticed my movements towards leopardness they said nothing about it either.

I am not very interested in masculine leadership (I am not that interested in leadership at all but masculine leadership is particularly dull), and I really don't like the dynamic of injecting it into the essential order that exists in the cosmos. The idea of a male God continually impregnating the necessarily female World, while understandable, is seriously unfortunate and even disgusting. It's like the height of profanity in the most sacred place possible. I can understand people intuitively jumping to that conclusion but why we would ever want to hold on to it is just baffling to me. It puts everyone in a bad place.

You might also discover that those components that belong are about three-quarters as beautiful as they might be if you changed them some so they interacted with each other more fluently.

The folks who actually have nowhere to go are, of course, middlemen who profit by distributing an artist's work to the public, often through old-fashioned channels. If these people are becoming professionally obsolete that is too bad for them but maybe they ought to go find a new line of work. A profession is only noble if it is needed--there is no reason to preserve it like an endangered species if society has moved on.
It's totally my pleasure! Those albums vary widely in style so I think there's gotta be something in there you'll dig. :P I'm a guitarist myself and I'm very interested in inventive approaches to the instrument, especially from jazz corridors--such approaches have been little-recognized in mainstream jazz since the '60s-'70s or so, it seems like (if you can even say what mainstream jazz /is/ anymore, rather hard). At one point I had a very similar feeling to what you expressed--it was confusing to me that there seemed to be this great renaissance in avant-garde playing in the mid-to-late 20th century with widely appreciated legends like Eric Dolphy, Ornette Coleman, Sun Ra and the like, but all the well-known guitarists seemed to be fairly conservative bop players. As it turns out, the experimental guitarists were totally there and continue to be, they just went rather underground. :P

The Trial is marked by intense numinousness. The overarching presence of the court, as an omnipresent, incomprehensible, and terrifying force that consumes Josef K. until it kills him and keeps him forever from redemption, invokes a remarkable religious dread that likens the text to a parable. In fact, Kafka's own spiritual sensibilities and relationship with creativity created in him a dread akin to that evoked by the court of the text and ultimately fearful of the fate, in metaphoric terms, that befalls Josef K, embodying a death of creative opportunity in the shadow of mundane familial and societal obligations in a manner which for Kafka had a distinctly spiritual and even markedly Gnostic quality. Ulimately, The Trial functions as an existential, secular, Gnostic parable of the modern age that evokes in metaphorical terms a fear of earthly consumption Kafka himself bore.

My name is Mitch. I have recently built a shed out of plywood. My hobbies include building sheds out of plywood. Sometimes I ride my bike. Other times I build bikes out of plywood. I built my father a bike out of four solid sheets of heavy plywood. It was fun. I build people out of plywood. They tell me jokes. I post these jokes on my website, www.plywoodpeopletellingjokes.com. It's a good quality website. It's made of plywood. I construct all things out of plywood. I created my yard using only one small sheet of chiseled granite. I actually build many things out of grandmothers. My grandmother does not approve of the construction of objects using grandmothers, but I don't really care about her opinion, because she's only a grandmother and cannot exactly defend herself, should the situation arise that I should feel the need to knock her unconscious. One fine November afternoon, I decided to take my grandmother for a walk down to the lake, where she swam around in circles in the water for three hours. I threw in a few grains of rice, which she gobbled up hungrily. I smiled at her innocence. One day she would realize that being a grandmother was only the first ticket to becoming an idolized gorilla. My grandmother has always aspired to become a gorilla and then proceed to influence many people and therefore become extremely famous. She has been excessively taking classes in the field of Gorilla-Becoming and the Art of Being Influential. I have urged her to use her skills in the field of physics to become a professional physic, but she keeps killing small rodents with her scimitar, which subtracts points from her total number of reputation points, lowering her likelihood of achieving any of her goals.

As an artist it is easy to get caught up in ideas about artistic quality. These ideas can really hamper your practice. You may carry around a giant rubric in your head that you use to evaluate every art piece you see, including your own, giving each one a score. You are likely to find that other pieces score higher than your own if you do this.

It pains me to give nutrition advice that I'm sure will lead to poor health at best, but in this case I think it's really for a greater good. You should switch from eating hot /Triceratops/ guts to fernsnot because I think it will be better for your health, but rather because the world will be better off in the long run if you die of starvation.
Those of you who are used to doing cut-ups with scissors may feel that this method is wicked, because it uses a computer and computers are supposed to be cold and inhuman and unfit for art. I don't think there are many things further from the truth, and it seems to me that this assumption is always made purely in the gut with no examination afterwards. Computers are, I think, perhaps the most human machines in the world today, and best regarded not as unfeeling automatons but as like Phillip Pullman's daemons.

A cow can lack a tail and still be standard--we may assume that it has lost its tail or been born without one. If a cow has something totally different in place of a tail, it will still probably seem like a cow, albeit likely an unusual, imaginary one.

If you're really interested in WILD and want to succeed, ending up in SP would be a fortunate thing for you, I promise. Keep your eyes closed, focus on your hypnagogia, and you'll probably find yourself in an LD quite rapidly.

Inspired by the graffiti in the library bathroom at Simon's Rock, I have invented a new drink known as Earl Grey Goose. It is sort of like an irish coffee for classholes. Here is the recipe:
I retreat into the bathroom to wash my hands and in the grimy mirror I see a chaste woman, in white, a flowing robe, silver armor, Joan of Arc perhaps or one like her. But looking at her face I see it is truly the face of the Monk.

Sometimes I think this is very problematic. I think of Sandi Metz's talk on the value of grit and perserverance, and I wonder if I would generally get more I cared about finished if I picked a single goal at a time and pursued it directly to its conclusion. It's possible that I would generally be happier.

I'm continually frustrated by the feeling that I don't fit in even in the spaces where it seems like I would most belong. I feel a weird mix of strong identification and bemusement at the words of all the people I admire. Sometimes they'll say something that seems //so true// and I'm thrilled to read or hear it. Other times they'll say something that seems sort of suspect to me, or just confusing, and inevitably I wonder if I'm right in finding it suspect or confusing. Maybe I don't understand my own immorality, or I lack the background or acuity to process what they're expressing.

It is notable that in some sense you are always alone in dreams. Although you may dream of others, like everything else in a dream you trust they are the product of your own self upon waking to a much greater degree than is possible in waking life. You can feel the other consciousness behind somebody's surface in waking life with visceral, irrefutable intensity, and the vivid flush of this feeling is absent in dreams. I believe it is this fact more than any other that has led people like William Burroughs(?) to point to dreams as more real than life, or even the only real life we have. But at the same time I would dispute this view--to say so does not do justice to the unanticipatable floridity of waking life, where reality certainly is if it is anywhere. Like all attitudes of its type it presents a cult of individuality, lost in a thirst for for-sure-ness--but you cannot know yourself for sure either, and the same mystery of life that lends it "unreality" is there in dreams too if you permit yourself to notice.

Zachary and I woke up at around 1:30. He was asleep when I woke up. I showered and shaved, and when I came back, he was awake. Lauren and her friend Amy came in, followed closely by Elliot. Elliot was making Amy's and asked Zach if he had some hot sauce he could put in it. Zach had Torchy's and Garven Store Grande Salsa. We discussed how the jar of Garven Store salsa was probably the only jar in all of Vermont, or even New England, which lead Zachary to decide that we should go get some chips at Hannaford's to eat that salsa with. We decided to go on the spur of the moment, but then Lauren and Amy disappeared, and Elliot went off to tend to his Amy's, so our departure was interrupted.

Zachary and Rosie - Are a couple and have very coupley interactions--they like to curl up with each other and talk to each other sweetly and kiss one another and slightly introduce what's going on for each of them otherwise every once in a while. There's a heavier dynamic, too, which seems to be perhaps what keeps them together: Rosie is someone who likes to take care of, and Zachary is a very intense, outward, non-self-conscious person who is very take-care-of-able as a result --- Zachary is someone who likes people who are very specific and unusual and cute(sy), and Rosie has an extremely unique place carved out for herself and is [small//thinks of herself as small, thinks well of that, and thus occupies that] and cute(/sort of cutesy). She seems to enjoy holding him when he wants that and listening to him talk and watching his antics, and she's glad to see when he's cleaned up after and when the people around him are in tune with or at least unimpacted by his antics (she likes him too much to necessarily do those things herself, it seems like, although she may also just be like straight-up unworried about them--it's hard to say if she's glad for them as a reflection of the desires of the other people around or directly from within herself). He gets really into how small and cute he sees her [/as/] being, and how specific and otherworldly she is. You can sort of tell that they've been together for a year--she sometimes gets frustrated with his lack of self-awareness and unwillingness to indulge her wants when they heavily conflict with his directly, and he sometimes gets conflicted by having strong internal desires that aren't hers, sensing what she wants, and not wanting to indulge her quite enough to go with her. They also don't really seek each other out with great heaviness--neither one seems to badly want the other, necessarily, when they're not around each other--if Rosie feels distraught, her impulse is to be distraught alone although she appreciates company (does she pine for him when he's not there but not tell him? if so, is he even aware? I wonder! how sad?!), and Zachary gets very involved in what's going on around him and doesn't feel a strong pull in himself towards her, to the point where I have ended up facilitating couple moments between them by suggesting that we go and visit her. (I wonder if they get so heavily coupleish around their other friends--almost certainly not--though maybe--, although that could be because both feel or at least Zachary feels comfortable enough around me to do that. Even that says something, though--when the three of us are in the room, often their dynamic pulls them together//they feel comfortable as a couple/dynamic with letting that happen even though I am there. I sort of wonder if Zachary, by a series of elaborate steps as opposed to directly, initiates that as a subconscious way of pulling tight to Rosie and not having Rosie and I snap together, although Rosie may also initiate those interactions--if she does (I just haven't been looking at them closely while they get into this state, outta, like, politeness) I imagine it is more out of a desire to receive Zachary''s latent heavy affections more heavily than anything else that's going on than any particular desire to pull tight to him and far away from others. Rosie does not seem to have any interest in keeping Zachary from me at all--in fact she happily lets us spend hours together while she's alone or doing other things--and when the three of us are together she'll gladly interact heavily with me, sometimes even until Zachary becomes really uncomfortable and makes that verbally explicit (not in a like, "Stop it, you're making me uncomfortable" way, but just almost--like that moment last night when he said that Rosie and I were talking about things he couldn't access and it made him feel insecure, which pulled Rosie to him.)()))))))&

  I first met him about three months ago. He appeared at a fairly small party I came along to with a few of my friends. We were all sitting in a circle around the living room coffee table. Four people were discussing where they had grown up--one was from rural Alberta, in Canada, another was from Grand Rapids, Michigan, and the last two were participating but had not yet gotten to say where they were from. Another group was talking about their favorite folk and then metal bands. To my right were a few people discussing craft beer.

I asked Zachary if he had paid me back for the Dave Koz tickets and he said that he hadn't. We had a slightly awkward conversation about it in which he said that the felt sort of like I should have reminded him about it and I said that I thought we were sharing the responsibility of doing that equally since we both knew where and when the show was. Eventually we both just decided that it was a sad but useful lesson to learn and that we should be more careful to go to shows we buy tickets to in the future, obviously. I felt really icky about bringing it up, as I usually do about reminding people to pay me back for things, but if he was going to do it at any time, now would be phenomenal, since I am so close to broke (I don't want to get my friends to give me money when I need it because that's my responsibility, but that's money that he owes me and would be paying me back for, but I still feel weird about it--uggghhh, it's just badness). He said he would after he got his next chunk of transcription work payment.

lyrics -- depiction of a person's face as made of plant parts:
Alberto Ginestera was a 20th-century Argentinian composer. He wrote one work for solo guitar, "Sonata Op. 47", that I think is bound to please you. Its harmonic and contrapuntal approaches share a lot with avant-garde jazz of the '60s/'70s and it has totally white-hot rhythmic energy. David Leisner's solo album /Music of the Human Spirit/ is, I believe, the only album on What.cd with the whole piece. His performance of the Ginastera is phenomenal. Poulenc's "Sarabande" on there I think is beautiful as well and The /Suite/ by Ned Rorem has some really cool moments.

This presents a special challenge to artists, too. All this freedom is daunting. In the past, there were far more conventions that instructed artists in how to design their work. As much as this was a limitation, it was also something of a luxury--you were free from having to design brand new structures and techniques to suit your artwork. Since everyone was working with largely the same conventions, your work was more easily comprehended by others, and if you wanted to deviate from those conventions, it could be clear what you were trying to push forward.

I'd like to say that the bright side of all this is that it's so bad it can only get better, but I don't want to jinx anything. Maybe the government will build a database of everyone who's Black and/or pro-choice, then have the military secretly capture and torture some of the Black folks to death and then openly kill the rest in drone strikes while the cops go around beating all the pro-choice folks to a bloody pulp and confiscating all the tampons. When an official or two gets reluctantly prosecuted over it a month or two after the rest of the world has exploded in outrage, they'll argue that the government was just defending itself and get acquitted. Any nations that seek to distance themselves from the U.S. afterwards will be openly threatened by the State Department until they step in line. The NRA will publicly celebrate and then say the main lesson to be learned is that civilians need to be able to openly carry MANPADS and RPGs. I wish this stuff was ridiculous enough to be funny.
: the pre-Revolution era of the Pilgrims, in which the natural world of America is seen both as an Eden-like haven overflowing with Gods bounty and an imposing chaotic wilderness to be conquered by civilization (both viewpoints characterized by an awe of the nature of America and a sense of immense scale dwarfing the new civilization within it), the period post-Revolution to the late 1800s, in which the natural world is seen as conquerable by America through the spread of American society and technological progress, culminating in ultimately successful efforts to bring all the land open to America between the two coasts under American dominion, the period from the end of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th, in which America seeks to analyze, systematize, and quantify the lands now under its control, the vast settlement mission of America being seen as complete, and the period from the late 20th century to the present day, in which Americans now have a sense of having gained the ability to truly manage the American landscape and are struggling with feelings of alienation from it stemming from the systems of abstraction created earlier in the 20th century and a sense that, through our overarching power over the land, we are mismanaging and damaging it.

He does concede that McCain is a "lunatic," and that Obama would make a much better president, but is convinced he can make no difference in the election's outcome. According to him, the only politicians who aren't in with the kaballist sect are Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul. Huh.

A rough hierarchy of harmonies from most to least consonant was recognized in the context of the key of the piece. In a piece in C major, the C-E-G major triad was the most consonant harmony possible, and other harmonies were understood as more consonant or dissonant in terms of how much they destabilized the sense of the C major triad as consonant. In other words, in a piece in C major, you can just play a C major chord and hang out there in ultimate consonance, but the moment you play some other chord you have moved some distance away from C major. You may have moved just a little bit away--like to G major, the dominant of C major, which sets up the ear for a return to C major and reinforces the sense that the key of the piece is C major--or really far away, like through a sequence of harmonies that establishes the sense that, say, the piece is now in the key of F# major.

The third dream was very me-Zach-Rosie-oriented. As I recall, I was living in a kind of backwater Kentucky-or-something town with Zachary and Rosie and the dream focused very heavily on Bennington, which I was trying to attend more or less for pleasure despite having already gotten a degree. Much of the dream centered around the logistics of me doing that--where I would live, how I would pay for it/convince the school to pay for it, why I wanted to despite having already graduated from a different college, etc., and what Zachary and Rosie and I would do while we were there together. I wanted to go to be with Zach and Rosie and because I thought it might be nice to experience being in college again at the point in my life I'm at now, since it might remind me of some things about that experience that I'd sort of forgotten or shoved under the rug or whatnot. We spent a lot of time driving around town in a van we sort of collectively owned, visiting friends we had. Towards the end of the dream, I think Zach and Rosie were leaving to go to Bennington or had already left, and I was trying to figure out how to get there--it seems like via this guy we all knew, who was a sort of cheeky Chinese guy, who had offered to drive me there. Actually, yeah, now that I'm thinking about it, I think I woke up while we were driving through this huge, sort of gleaming golden/ruby city that had a giant suspension bridge, that I think my traveling companion said was San Francisco (why we were driving through San Francisco on a Kentucky --> Vermont trip is, like, lost on me, of course). I'm not sure I ever really figured out a total solution for how I was going to go to Bennington, but I had decided just to wing what I hadn't yet pinned down when I got there.

P.S.

Yay, we're done! That's how you essence!

At first, it might just seem like you need to figure out how to play with the people near to you, but eventually you discover that the stakes are much higher. A lot of people in this dimension are really attached to the gigantic band playing a certain style of music as a whole, and they expect everyone with a violin to be playing certain kinds of violin music and everyone with a cello to be playing certain kinds of cello music so that this style can be produced. A fair number of other people are more democratic; they think that everyone with a cello should get to play whatever kind of cello music they want and everyone with a violin should get to play whatever kinds of violin music they want, more or less. This is often because they realize that they've grown attached to the style of music they're playing and really wouldn't like it if someone tried to get them to play differently, even if that is unlikely to happen because they're playing a popular style, so they don't want to do that to other people. In any case, these camps combined constitute most of the band, and people within them tend often to not even have thought about the fact that they are playing in a band at all (since that's what you do in this dimension, and they've been doing it forever), and usually feel pretty good about it on the whole if they have. Usually, when they have thought about it, they have thought about how there are people with violins, and people with cellos, and they are playing together, and they've used most of their further thoughts on this to flesh out the specifics of that concept.
<b>David Tennant</b> is the star of the show, as Sal Eldridge, an American ex-pat detective in the Trumps Society. He is somewhat reclusive, and has a tendency towards spaciness and wall-eyedness; he began to see the Resonant Sphere as a young teen, and is greatly attached to its beauty, having a hard time controlling when he rises into it and becoming "lost" there sometimes at random. He might have an easier time controlling this if he tried harder, but he has something of a desire to be there always, and secretly regards the material world as a prison due to his attachment to the transcendent beauty of the Sphere. He was drawn to being a detective by a desire to exercise his analytical abilities and out of a perverse love of violence, but when he took a job as an analogue to a low-level case the Trumps Society was working on (which sometimes hires outside help, but does its best to keep them in the dark about what is really going on), he figured out a good deal about the true background of the case, and when he pressed the Society about it, they, heavily impressed, hired Eldridge to fill the place of the recently deceased Simon Barthe, both on the basis of his keen detective work and to keep him from spreading what he had discovered around. He is sometimes prone to bouts of depression that greatly reduce his ability to work on cases and generate friction between him and his co-workers. He is witty at times, having a dry and dark sense of humor, but is also hard to get along with, primarily due to his introversion and mean-spiritedness. He has no very close friends, though he is on good enough terms with some of his co-workers and is willing to spend time outside of work with them, especially drinking engagements, and is unable to maintain any romantic relationships he gets involved in for longer than a couple of months. He is an amateur poet, and episodes sometimes begin with him reading some of his poetry aloud, often as a voiceover with introductory imagery not depicting him.

I think it might be worth identifying romance as "social interaction tied in some way to sex, or intense emotional intimacy in social interaction" or something, since it seems to more elegantly distinguish between the two ways people generally seem to feel about romance. It seems important to me to recognize that when romantic interaction is sexual it's because the people involved recognize or at least suspect that it has a sexual quality or link in some way, and when it's not sexual it's in the same way, no matter what the broader culture tends to categorize the form of the interaction in question as.

That said, although you can definitely set up your academic life so you have time to do almost nothing but work, you can also probably set it up so that you can get your work done and still have a comfortable amount of free time. This can be sort of an art, depending on who you are and what you want, but you'll probably figure it out if you do decide to go. Also, it's generally difficult because the work you're being asked to do requires a lot of thought and the standards are high, not because you're just given a meaninglessly gigantic workload, which is really nice if that's what you like in academics.

The presence of the possibility of salvation through such transport here, even if not realized as it is not in the death of Josef K., is made overt through the presence of the radiance of the Law and the figure in the window. It reflects exactly the Gnostic sentiment that the world as it is known is a prison, a sort of mundane hell created by a flawed god where humanity is trapped, and that the path to redemption is to escape from it and reach another god, which man originally fell from, that is loving and blissful but entirely outside the known universe (Sokel, 8-9).

Now, you might say that this action is hurting <c.c.> by cutting into the money they need to make to get by through their work. But <c.c> certainly doesn't make anywhere near the bulk of their income from score sales--aside from the people performing their pieces, almost nobody buys them, which is why they're being sold by an obscure Swiss publisher. <C.c.> makes their bread and butter from their university post, grants, and commissions, none of which can be shared on trackers. What you would really be saying is that it is of top-level importance for <c.c> to be able to generate as much cash from their work as they possibly can--not enough to live on, not enough to sustain their composition career comfortably, even, but as much as they possibly can, all removable barriers removed. So: should we ask <c.c.> to give up a small part of the potential profits of their work for the good of the musical community at large? Not all of it--a very small part, one with little commercial value but immense cultural value. Yes! Of course we should! What is wrong with everybody?

In one dream, I had a vagina, though everything else about my body was the same as in waking life. In the dream, I had been born that way, and felt glad about it, because it seemed to match the ambiguous manner in which I related to gender. At one point, I had to explain to a gal that I was about to sleep with (had recently started a relationship with? I think so), while we were in bed together, that I was intersexed and it would be something we'd have to think about like logistically with sex. She was intrigued, and asked a lot of questions (what my genetics were like---I said I was probably some sort of chromosomal mosaic--though of course in waking life that wouldn't really work--whether I was sterile--I said almost certainly--how I felt about it--well--and so on), and luckily wasn't perturbed at all.

I am an artist inasmuch as I am a person who makes art. Am I a professional? Absolutely not--I work day jobs. Would I like to become a professional? Absolutely--it would give me more time to devote singularly to art. Someone might assume that a person in my position, "wanting to "make it," would cringe at the idea of a bunch of e-folks swapping my art amongst themselves without ever paying me for it. Horseshit! It's a bunch of unfortunate nonsense and I don't understand why so many droves seem to make exactly that assumption.
In any case, my peers in elementary school seized on my leopardishness with rabid aggression. More than once every day, I would do something that carelessly betrayed my leopard habits--the way I sat, the things I made, my struggles with activities common to elephant children that I hadn't been much exposed to. Inevitably, the other calves would scream and holler that I was acting like a /leopoard/, of all things, and would do anything from laugh at me to physically attack me. I had a single friend, but she was fair-weather--she had a larger group that she liked to hang out with and often would pick them over me. I asked her if I could join them one day and she told me that I should stay away because they hated me. I thought of telling her that I thought it was wrong for her to be friends with me and elephants like that, but if she had abandoned me I would have been a complete pariah.

As Sokel does well to point out, this metaphor should not be construed in terms of a conflict between the religious and the worldly dimensions of the self&for the earthly chain has itself the force of religio (5); both are numinous entities.
As someone who identifies primarily as an artist but who considers the social sciences an invaluable and vital resource in the understanding and production of my art, rather than someone who is interested in studying art from the perspective of social theories primarily to further their exploration of the social sciences, I believe I will be able to bring a unique and interesting perspective to the seminar. I am deeply passionate about the social sciences and specifically the topic of origin, and consider the work the seminar has as its mission to pursue to have importance to me both in terms of my academic work and on a level that is deeply personal. For these reasons, I believe I will be able to engage in the work of the seminar with thoroughness and vigor.

I am in a just wonderful mood now! I went outside and watched everyone and waved to a few people and then took some field recordings. It's nice to know that I can take field recordings if I want a "role" to play that I can enjoy in public space that's not purely ambient or interactive. I love having field recordings, and the novelty of seeing someone outside taking field-recording-type actions seems like a good signal to present to the ambient social environment to attract the sorts of people I might like to talk to.

Episodes are an hour long and generally consist of a reading of Eldridge's poetry that relates to the storyline of the episode, frequently relating to intentional or accidental interactions with the Resonant Sphere, following which the case of the episode is followed and solved. <i>Milk and Scissors</i> is semi-episodic, with many episodes partially self-contained but also frequently relating to a larger storyline being played out over the course of that season or of multiple seasons. Season finales tend to revolve around the resolution of storylines, frequently those revolving around a higher-level person or group involved with the Grael Society going rogue or developing an ideology destructive to the Society or to humanity in general, especially those relating to the discovery or use of nuclear weapons.

Soââwhat should I do right now? There's a compelling argument that I should shower, because I'll feel more immediately comfortable, and then study Backbone, because it's a more urgent goal than working on music, studying Zizek, etc. I might feel happy in the moment working on non-Backbone projects, but there will always be a net detractor from my happiness as long as I haven't finished my present course of programming study, and it will get more intense as time goes on. I'll be very happy when I finish my music project, because I love the music I'm producing, but there's not much reason to think that the happiness I'll reap will diminish with time, so that I could claim it whenever it makes the most sense to do so in terms of what else is going on in my life. The only reason I haven't already done these things today is, I think, because I doubt I'll be as pleased in the moment studying Backbone and the long-term cost-benefit picture only slightly bends towards the benefits of doing that study.

If you are not an elephant or a leopard, you may not know that prejudice against leopards is particularly common amongst elephants. Our herbivourosness tends to foster an instinctive dislike of most predators, especially pure carnivores like big cats, but leopards get it worst than most, I think. Although I grew up a long way from Africa, we share an ancestral environment, so perhaps this dislike stretches into the misty past. In any case, there is a pervasive image of leopards as conniving, selfish, and physically weak. I think lions are better-liked because they live in groups, which we can relate to, and we appreciate the great size and power of tigers even though they are individualists. All such species suffer amongst elephants and I don't want to say that leopards always have it worse. I think there are a lot of elephants who have never thought much about tigers, though, who could go on and on about how frustrating, wicked, and petty leopards are.

<b>Bill Murray</b> is Arthur Hamilton, Mackenzie Hamilton's father. He is a supporting character who sometimes makes an appearance as an informant or as a buddy of Eldridge's, who met him at a family reunion of "Mack" Hamilton's that Eldridge was brought to as a guest. He shares the sense of humor that both "Mack" and Eldridge have in common, but is more somber, and respects Eldridge's sensibilities and mentality; hence, their relationship is able to go beyond humor into philosophical speculation, discussions of literature, and shared personal experiences. Eldridge hopes that as "Mack" grows older he will become more like his father, but does not reveal this to "Mack"; however, it does color their interactions, especially at times when Eldridge is in close communication with Arthur.

Furthermore, radiation exposure has its notoriously wide spectrum of possible effects. It shares its insidious invisibility with pathogenic microorganisms, definitely, but disease caused by infection normally has a fairly specific constellation of symptoms, a known course with a few important complications, and so on. Radiation exposure can produce anything from nothing identifiable, to a slight increase in long-term cancer risk, to a marked increase, to acute illness and a high chance of developing cancer within a few years or less, to inevitably fatal acute illness that runs a rapid course. The specific symptoms can also vary widely depending on the material in question and how the dose was absorbed. Radioactive particulates spread readily in air and water over long distances, too, and some take a very long time to decay. All of these factors combined make it dangerously easy to develop a feeling that a nuclear disaster halfway around the world could be poisoning your food, air, and water without you being able to tell, in a mysterious way that produces no immediately identifiable effects but will ultimately kill you in the years to come. This is all true of exposure to certain chemicals too, of course, but again I think fears of such occurrences on a disastrous scale are comparatively lower just because theyve happened less often.

One dream recalled; took place in Texas desert-forest imagery (Concan-esque). Small settlement in the woods off a long highway. Beginning of dream recall had videogame dynamics with "assists" and "kills" in some manner; I got many kills but little assists, whereas Gerry, who was there, gave the assist for nearly all of my kills but got very little himself. Later there was a transition to people in the settlement trying to get a job at some sort of corporate food chain nearby--the job application process was driving-oriented and mainly involved a series of difficult driving tests. We all, but mainly Zachary and I, commiserated about the difficulty of the tests and hoped that we would manage to get work there. I woke up while trying to operate a sedan that appeared to have a single pedal for clutch and brake.

Once you've got a set of components and you know what they're doing and why, see if they can tell you what they're all doing together. They might know right away. If so, great. If not, you might have to figure it out for them. Take a look at what each one of them is doing and think about how that interacts with what the others are doing. Maybe two of them are doing things that would be nice right next to each other. Try getting them to stand together. Perhaps they look good that way. Maybe one of them seems to be off in their own world. Have them stand over to the side for now--they might have a good place to be later, but it might also turn out that they should be a part of a different group that has more in common with them.

Inevitably I'm afraid that if I express myself I'll offend and confuse people. I want to be perfectly understood and upset no one, ideally. At the same time I have a lot of opinions that other people detest. For this reason I probably can't avoid upsetting some people if I express my opinions. In some ways I'm not that worried about thisÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂif someone comes along who holds opinion /I/ find detestable and disagrees with me, that just seems inevitable. What I'm really worried about is having people I respect find fault with my picture of the world and reject me. In some cases there are no second chances with these peopleÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂthere are so many people out there abusing them that they don't have time or energy to invest in anyone that gives off the impression of being out to hurt them. That makes sense to me; it seems pragmatic.

For ages, I had decided I wouldn't mention it until I had the whole thing finished and just surprise you, but at this point I think you are definitely owed a well-overdue apology. I have a similar problem with mix CDs as I do with written communication--in the past I have spent over sixty hours on mixes that are sometimes not even more than a half-hour long, to the detriment of Things--which falls under the same category of personal dynamics I'm trying to improve, and I promise I'll send a flurry of custom-tailored mixes your way soon.

discussion of Wallace quote seems like it leaves important things unsaid; good material but sounds introductory (as I suppose it would, being from the introduction), like it's setting the nugget of the argument up; what follows it? it seems like it ties in with the idea of terror encased but hidden in one's own psychic territory brought up earlier during the psychoanalytic discussion, perhaps that this terror is inevitably encountered when one ventures into territories entirely composed of one's own subjective psychic energies, as in dreams? is this right or am I off the mark?

James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, lied under oath to Congress in March when he denied that the NSA collects any data on millions of Americans. The Director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, did as well. They are both guilty of perjury, and there have been calls by some members of Congress as well as many journalists for at least their resignation if not prosecution. Notably, Salon columnist David Sirota pointed out that if the Justice Department is willing to prosecute baseball pitcher Roger Clemens for perjuring Congress, they must prosecute Clapper and Alexander as well, or they will fail to uphold equal protection. Despite this, Snowden is the only one to be charged with anything relating to his revelations of indiscriminate spying by the NSA.

3. You can go to another school after your freshman year, and usually a few people do this every year in some way or another. Everything that Dan said is definitely worth considering--often, common or even universal classes for freshman, like Freshman Seminar, don't fit easily or anywhere into the course structures that other schools have, making it hard to get enough transfer credits to enter somewhere as a sophomore, even if you can transfer. If you do well academically as a freshman and are content entering another college as a freshman afterwards, though, odds are pretty good that wherever you want to go will accept you, I think. In this way, going to the Rock can be a good way to get out of high school even if you don't stay. The Rock will almost certainly have you back if you decide you don't like wherever you transferred and want to return, too, although you might run into financial aid trouble (probably not worth worrying about this sort of thing at all where you are right now, though).

And there's so many other big mammals I haven't even gotten too, and they're all amazing. I'm naturally proud of my own species, but I wish you could see an elephant.

The release of radioactive material as a disaster certainly isnt unique in being a large-scale danger, but I think its special place in the mind of the general public isnt entirely irrational. There are some things that genuinely set it apart. Its partially distinguished by its immediacyit can happen in the blink of an eye, as opposed to something like global warming that takes place over a larger timescale. The degree of harm it can produce is determined heavily by human action, which contrasts it with natural disasters that we struggle to control or even helpfully predict, and that degree of human agency can fuel a sense of mistrust and suspicion of conspiracy on the part of those working to prevent or contain radiation accidents. This puts it in a similar category as pandemics, which are closer to natural disasters but are far more influenced by human intervention and control in a way that fuels paranoia, and especially chemical and other industrial accidents, which are generally similar. However, it is unique both in the potential longevity of the damage it can produce (neither pandemics nor chemical accidents have rendered swaths of land uninhabitable for centuries) and in the frequency of its occurrence, which I think has particularly sensitized the public.

The fifth characteristic is vital, too, but it has some wiggle room. It depends on how easily you think a lid can be removed and how easy it is to drink out of the object in question with the lid on. Again, if I ran into an object with the first two characteristics and a snap-on lid with no holes, I might call it a cup, but I'd probably just call it a container and clock out for the day. You could probably argue that the lid of a cup must have either a hole for a straw or for easy drinking (as with a sippy cup) to be a cup, always, and I wouldn't necessarily disagree.

Cows usually have four legs, but a cow with more or less legs is still a cow, just a weird or injured one.

What do I call a cow? Ooph, this is already much harder! There's nothing central about a cow that gives it "cowness." I do know this, though: a cow is a cow because of how it affects me sensorily. A cow looks a certain way, it has a certain texture, it produces certain sounds, and so on. What's more, cows are usually found in certain environments--grassy areas where they can graze. I have some abstract associations for cows--cuteness, pastorality, farming, and so on--but they are broad categories that touch a bunch of things that aren't cows, and they can't be specified enough while still being abstract to include only cows--you've gotta get sensory with your description at some point or you'll always include other things that aren't cows.

I got in an argument with Damon, who was making dinner, about whether or not I should come to the table when he suggested I do so, or wait to finish the stories I was reading.

 The woods were cool and peaty and private and a weighty relief. I knew a way through them from there to Aaron's room, Nick and Aaron's regular haunt since I was sleeping in Nick's.

I fantasized about carving a den out of a hillside with my hands and supporting it with gathered sticks, growing a small plot of mushrooms, deerskin shoes. White ribbon tendrils played rapidly around the tree branches as glowing blue discs orbited my hands.

I have come to the realization, over too long a time, that this is silly. After all, I read things you folks write about yourselves and your interests and activities and such all the time with great enjoyment, and it stands to reason that you probably would not have friended me if you did not want to read the same from my end. So, with that in mind, I am going to do my best to get over myself and actually make regular use of this thing, rather than using it exclusively for two-second shout-outs to cetaceans, celestial events, or other things that will probably never read them. To get off to a proper start, I have used it today with Extra Vigor.
as I listened to "Sawdust and Diamonds" the kitchen window became a sheet of water that droplets of (rain?)water fell through horizontally until they fell in such a volume that the sheet became "full" and slowly denser and denser until it became glass, and then the droplets of water fell through the glass, shattering it every time they fell through, until they formed a "pool" of water in a column horizontally across the boundary between the kitchen and living room in a rectangle the shape of the outermost edge of the window and then slowly that pool became denser and denser until it coalesced into a gigantic pollen grain right across from me next to the piano about the size of a large beach ball which emitted tiny flowers that formed a spiraling circular fractal behind it as the song ended

Maybe at this moment you are wondering what I mean by "components". You might have the sense that it's hard to figure out what the components are. Consider a photo of a dog lying on the front lawn of a house with the street showing in the bottom of the photo. Are the lawn and the street separate components, or are they one thing, the ground? Should they be grouped together with the sky, as composing the landscape? If so, should the house be included too, or is it not a part of the landscape? Maybe the lawn should be grouped with the house as a unit instead? Should the dog be included, then?
 and if you go on to ask them what differences they mean specifically, they are liable to give you a rundown of the characteristics we commonly associate with masculinity and femininity

Reading Zizek or working on music feels productive to me, which is probably part of what contributes to this. Right now, I feel like studying Backbone is a sort of "base" activity compared with either of those, even though I also feel it would be of great benefit to me. I think part of the dynamic is that I don't have much of an emotional attachment to making moneyââI like the idea of having my own place and so on, but the indirectness of those benefits makes them harder to care about (what I'm working towards is a full-time job, which presumably will then net me benefits of increased independence and so on, instead of my studying work being a direct link to those benefits). Also, the desirable benefits in themselves are less important to me than the ability to study and produce art and so on which I already have in this position. The other side of the worth of studying Backbone, the ability to make art and artistic tools, varies in desirability depending on where my artistic interests lie. Right now, I'm really engaged in a music project that doesn't require any programming knowledge thus far, so I'm more interested in working on that and studying electronic music production techniques and so on.

They both recorded a live album with Charlie Byrd called /Great Guitars at the Winery/ that I'm sure you'd find very pleasant.

A little over a year ago, a friend of mine with an art gallery asked me if I would submit a piece to a show of hers and I wrote something in JavaScript for it (www.machineandthegarden.com). I was reminded how much I loved to program, and started looking into doing it for a living. At first I was going to JavaScript meetups to test the waters of that community, and met someone at one of them who was organizing a Rails hackathon to make apps for the benefit of the general local community. That sounded cool to me and I was curious about Ruby, so I went, By the end of the day I'd fallen in love with Ruby and decided I want to understand it deeply.

As I walked back to my desk, I reflected with a despairing frustration that, rightfully, after doing this Cupid ought to swoop down and carry me off to live immortally in ecstasy. But, in the end, I had been coerced to throw the fleece into a gaping maw that, for doing so, would spit back at me a small pile of idolatrous tokens, precisely the same amount I received every two weeks in my paycheck, no more, no less. A true Hell! My heart was only kept alive by the sense that, one day, in the movement of bits too and fro, Cupid might indeed swoop in and say, "From this you are released--you are coming with me."

Postmodernism is, of course, only useful like so far as an idea in that everything from the early 20th century or so to now can be called modernist, in that the essential modernist attitude, that today is unique and demands new techniques to be described (hence the "modern" in modernism), is vibrantly alive and I think any of us would be hard pressed to even imagine a future where it stopped being so. But there's definitely a difference in character between art from the early 20th century to WWII and art from, say, post-WWII to the 1990s when the internet came into being (obviously all this is painting in broad strokes and is controversial but the broad strokes are sufficient to describe the idea).

This opens section three, from "of that Bay Area kush" to "get it understood". Lamar returns to a speaking pattern, although his pitch emphasis on the violet-colored rhymes gives his delivery a sprechstimme quality that makes it more melodic that the previous spoken material. The rhyme pattern follows the now-familiar technique of setting up a rhyme, moving to a different interior rhyme, and then answering the rhyme that was initially set-up. The rhymes all fall on downbeats. This material presents a dramatic shift downwards in energy level from the previous material, and narratively serves to set up the central image of the verse.

This one was memorable to me because it was more complex than most of them. Generally, when they happen, I'm lying in bed trying to fall asleep and an image begins to materialize that looks more-or-less like what I would see if my eyes were open. At first, I wonder if I'm starting to dream or if I've just opened my eyes without noticing. If the image fully comes together, I'll look around at my room and usually notice subtle differences about it that make me confident that I'm dreaming. Then I'll rummage around my "room" for a few moments before waking up.

Someone who really endorses the analytic approach would probably be inclined to call all crit theory bunk on the basis that it plays fast and loose with concepts that the analytic philosopher would say we don't know about well enough to use aside from looking at them straight ahead. On the flip side, analytic philosophy seems relatively unable to wrangle with certain concepts that are undeniably major parts of the human experience, as major as the sort of experiential "building blocks" that are dealt with in the analytic tradition but a lot more "fuzzy"--gender, say. An analytic philosopher might have a hard time feeling comfortable saying much about gender aside from looking at its most essential components--they probably wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole a paper about something like the public rituals of gender in urban West Africa where a crit theorist would feel pretty comfortable. Ironically, perhaps, a lot of crit theorists seem to have a similar reaction to analytic work--they are often skeptical of anything particularly quantitative or "formal" and will point to quantitative discourse as a means of concealing and enforcing qualitative values. Just as an analytic philosopher might question the logical assumptions behind a crit theory paper, a crit theorist might question the assumptions about the human experience behind an analytic paper.

Now we can finish our essence! First and foremost, a cup is a vessel for quick consumption of liquids, full stop. Anything being used for this purpose is a cup or is being "used as a cup." If we see an object out in the world and think it might be a cup, we can be sure by seeing how well it can be used as a cup and whether it seems to be meant to be used more clearly for something else, which we do by checking its morphological characteristics with the list above. A cup is an abstract category with sensory implications--its essence is abstract, but it implies a certain sensory experience.

Hi! So, I have a question: six of my friends are coming to stay at your hostel this weekend; they booked a private room for six under the name Katie Corcoran. When they booked the room, it looked like I wasn't going to be able to go, but now I can; I was wondering if, if I payed the price for a bed for three nights (which I guess comes out to about $53 USD?) I could just stay in that room with them. If not, should I book a bed somewhere else in the building? Thanks.

Keiji Haino is a Japanese guitarist who's also been active for decades. His output is perhaps even more varied than Frith--everything from drone and ambient to rock and blues to wild free improvisation. Generally his output is passionately emotional and distinctively his regardless of style. In the context of your post you might really dig his free improv (but you might also enjoy anything else he's done). He recorded a wonderful live album with Jim O'Rourke and Oren Ambarchi this year called /Now While It's Still Warm Let Us Pour In All The Mystery/ (they've been recording together in this manner for a while but this album is especially good from them).

I totally agree--I think I've felt that way for years, and more and more so as time goes on. "Modern life" seems to me to be heavily predicated on like a couple of basic misunderstandings about the essence of living--but then again, I go back and forth between feeling that way and like my experience of the world must be so different from the people around me that what they are doing genuinely is working for them even though it wouldn't for me at all. I often feel that the things you describe /do/ have worth--a career, a family, American culture--but not as thought of by people here generally. I think when I define those things in ways that make them sound interesting or appealing to me I am defining them in ways that the people around me seem never to at all.

I think "queer" could maybe be defined more explicitly--your definition seems totally accurate but I'm not sure someone who wasn't already familiar with the word would get a good sense of it from that definition. Maybe something like "outside of a cisgendered, heterosexual identity in some way; sometimes used to indicate an identity separate from mainstream LGBT identities," or whatever, would give someone unfamiliar with queerness as a concept a heavier understanding.

Eventually, we made our way back to the big house and holed up in a tiny room above the garage. There was a small television there. We watched a movie on it that was an action-thriller about a woman who comes into conflict with a group of eco-terrorists. The eco-terrorists were a strange bunch, thoughâthey were after the protaganist because she let animals do as they pleased, and they thought the things she allowed animals to do harmed the environment. They thought that animals should be tightly controlled or even killed to prevent them from harming the Earth. :????: It was a tense film with a lot of guns and shouting and helicopters and people wearing black clothes and so on.

After this, the line "somebody walked in with a pound" serves to rapidly connect the second and third sections. It's sung in a melodic pattern connected to the material preceding it, but unharmonized, and hitting the VII as a way to move briefly off from I without as drastic a transition as III or IV. Its rhyme "pound" connects it to the preceding two lines but in a less heavy pattern as it lacks a rhyme for mood/do. Narratively, this is the moment where the energy is sucked out of the room as the sexual tension is defused by someone else's entrance. The dialing down of devices used in the previous material lowers the musical energy level to reflect the narrative event, and again the beat moves to compensate.
The secrecy with which many governments and companies have handled nuclear accidents doesnt help either. From Mayak to Chernobyl to Castle Bravo to Fukushima, there is a trend of cover-ups and efforts to mislead the public, cooperating organizations, and those employed to clean up the disaster, such that we often only understand the true scale of what has happened years later. This makes it easy to worry that there may be nuclear accidents happening in secret, maybe nearby to you, even if theres nothing in particular to suggest it. It also makes it easy to worry that any nuclear accident that does occur is far worse than youre being told.
 There's a saying about Rockers that goes if you put two of 'em in a room they will find each other, even if the room is the size of a colosseum and filled floor to ceiling with writhing, screaming, starving prisoners. The same saying goes on to talk about how once you have gone to the Rock your life will never follow any likely pattern. This is due to an unusual field that surrounds Rockers. It is a Field of Improbability. On the Rock campus the Field is very powerful which is what produces the alternate universe characteristics of the Rock. The Field has caused the Rock to tunnel through the standard universe and flesh out its own pocket.

Throughout the common practice period, "tension" was looked at structurally in terms of harmonic dissonance, and "release" was looked at structurally in terms of resolution of harmonic dissonance gracefully into harmonic consonance. There's more to it than that, though--for instance, a major triad sounds consonant on its own, but some major triads sound dissonant when played one after the other. This is why the concept of keys exists. Each piece had a single tone in the Western scale (like A, F#, etc.) that was used to orient it in relation to all of the other tones (this is where the term "tonal" comes from!).

The solution to this problem would be to take action to encourage greater competition in the marketplace, not less. Commissioner McDowell, your statement that the notion that broadcasters may distribute their content through radio, television, the Internet, mobile devices and other unforeseen portals, but must be prohibited by law from printing the same content on the medium of newsprint, seems anachronistic at best appears to me to describe the present situation accurately but miss the most vital point: the media landscape is barren because a few large broadcasters are allowed to operate so widely.

We are free to structure our art in a way that more precisely fits it than ever before. To do this, we must not shy away from the challenge of creating that structure. We must revel in the playful joy of that challenge with all the energy we put into making beautiful components. In this way, the promise of making great art is held out to us.

5. Standard cows have four legs. If a cow lacks legs but you can see that it used to have them--if they've been cut off, for instance--it's an injured cow, and if it seems to have never had legs at all, it's either a strange real cow, one born quite odd, or it's imaginary. If it has something totally different in place of legs, it's still probably recognizable as a cow, but a very unusual, imaginary cow.

The following material, from "Hope that I" to "nothin' we can do now" is introspective in narrative content, the first and only instance of this appropriate as this is the high point of emotional intensity for Lamar within the narrative. The focus moves to Lamar's feeling of excitement and the music helps the listener empathize--the material is sung in the verse's most involved melodic pattern and the rhyme scheme is very intricate, with rhymes in every beat including a repeating three-rhyme pattern at the beginning of each line. These devices maximize the energy level of the material and the beat behind it moves to compensate.

It may well be possible, it is even probable, that in the first stage of its development the religious consciousness started with only one of its poles--the 'daunting' aspect of the numen --and so at first took shape only as 'daemonic dread'. But if this did not point to something beyond itself, if it were not but one 'moment' of a completer experience, pressing up gradually into consciousness, then no transition would be possible to the feelings of positive self-surrender to the numen.

Certain types of art music, bebop, and DJ Screw's hip hop are the most ideal sorts of music for that that I've found--music that you can pay close attention to and enjoy deeply that way but also have in the background of your thought and enjoy deeply that way too for sure. Those sorts of art music are probably what I go to most often in those situations and depending on the specific atmosphere I feel in the mood for I typically go to Josquin, Bach fugues, Beethoven symphonies, Brahms symphonies, early Schoenberg, anything by Webern, and Steve Reich's /Piano Phase/ or /Music for 18 Musicians/. With bebop and DJ Screw I think pretty much anything good goes but as I said I go to art music most often so if I went to those other two as often I might have more specific opinions. I can put together a collection of these for you if you want, along with that playlist of music that disintegrates from something else more basic or chaotic into itself despite itself if you still want that after all this time.

Someone with low Guts is submissive and frightened of authority. A very high score implies an above-the-law type who casually breaks rules and has an easy rapport with those who would enforce them; a very low score implies someone who will see rules in a situation they are afraid to break even when no such rules exist.

The Resonant Sphere is a space outside of normal space, but having a relationship with it and abilities to influence it, consisting mainly of areas of intense geometric beauty, cascading fractals, dimensions of infinite fire, and the like. It is able to be seen by certain individuals who stumble upon it, frequently by pure intuition, though an ability to perceive the Space can also be taught. It has a notable but mostly unseen presence in the world; most notably, radioactivity can be understood as a product of the Space bleeding into normal space through various Resonant substances, and nuclear weaponry as the outcome of letting a vast amount of energy from the Space bleed into normal space all at one time. A worldwide secret society, the Grael Group, almost exclusively maintains awareness of this space, due to their principle of inducting anyone who becomes aware of it into their folds. They are so named due to their regarding of the techniques necessary to produce nuclear weapons as a kind of Holy Grail, and their commitment to preventing the execution of these techniques outside of their proper time and place. They first allow the development and use of nuclear weapons at the end of World War II, considering it necessary to prevent an apocalypse in the form of an ill-fated world order at the hands of the Axis, though these events take place over a decade after <i>Milk and Scissors</i>.

I'm not really sure what to say or think about the quality of my life these days--"quality" both in terms of goodness/badness and in terms of the general atmosphere. The good parts seem less good and the bad parts seem less bad, and I'm not pleased with that but nearly everything I've tried to improve that dynamic has just damped the goodness and amplified the badness, with the exception of visiting Chicago where I was probably the happiest I've been since 2008-9 for the two weeks I was there. From a few months after graduation to last October I worked as a data center technician in Austin which was one of the most hideous universes I've ever entered (I have all sorts of funnyawful stories that probably are best told in person). I finally escaped and then moved to Eugene, Oregon, which was also pretty hideous in a different set of ways (the data center was inhuman and static in culture and Eugene was passive-agressive and profane in culture although the natural environment was overwhelmingly fantastic there). Now I'm in Austin again and trying to find a pattern through which I can consistently get work that I can stand and have enough space in my life to make art all the time.

Instead, I think we need to change the paradigm around how we diagnose. I do think there's a problem with parents in the U.S. being eager to pathologize and medicate their children for exhibiting behavior that's either normal or a sign of ongoing distress for environmental reasons. Ironically, in contrast to the article, the most unruly, disobedient kids I've encountered in my life had overly strict parents who would punish their children frequently; when their parents weren't around they'd act monstrous in an effort to let out all the frustration and pent-up impulse that their parents weren't giving them an outlet for. There are certainly some kids who act that way in response to ADHD, but the kids I've known (and adults I know now) with ADHD have more or less universally exhibited symptoms in more complicated ways. I think kids who are extremely fidgety, sidetrack themselves from work regularly even when they sit down intending to do it,

First off, my gut reaction about Timothy (from the little that you've said) is that no matter how committed to you he claims to be, if you've had as bad an experience with him in the past as you have, he probably hasn't made a full reversal in a year or two. It's quite possible that when you started moving on and dating other people, it really hit him that you weren't attached to him anymore (or at least were giving that impression) and that made him feel panicked and desperate to get you back--but I really wouldn't be surprised if he fell back into his old patterns if and when the two of you got together. In my experience it's pretty ordinary for people who have a hard time really maintaining commitment and honesty in a relationship to get really desperate after a break up and suddenly realize that the person they were treating like shit who was giving them all this love and affection is the best person ever once that love and affection stops; if anything, a lot of their terrible behavior in a relationship comes from the same lack of self-esteem that leads them to want that affection back so desperately when they lose it, even if they can't reciprocate properly when it's actually being given to them.

WOOOOOOF. This was a difficult trip in some ways. That's okay, but that is how it was. At its peak the combination stimulus of Rioux ( + Rioux v. Keija ) and Zachary being aggressive and ambiently combative made my external social environment pretty heavily inhospitable and I felt very overwhelmed and hurt even. I wish Zachary was nicer to me. Goddammit but like that's just how it is. I know he means well and is just acting on impulse but his impulses have actual meaning and content which I don't think he really acknowledges much. In a way I feel touched, like in a first-grader-being-picked-on-by-another-kid-who-has-a-crush-on-them way. But like we should be able to interact better than that.
Normalcy -- how normal you come off to others. Someone with high Normalcy registers as close to the mean in their appearance and speech. This is advantageous as people in this world are generally suspicious of others who make an impression on them as unusual, and even those with low Normalcy who tend to dislike "normals" are mostly concerned with a person's mindset and will generally approve of someone who has a regular look and feel if that person expresses opinions they agree with or shares their interests. Note that this only covers the impression someone gives off, not their internal personality--someone can have high Normalcy and entertain bizarre private thoughts that they never give evidence of in public. The average score is 7--the conformist nature of the culture means both that people tend to be close to the mean and that it's possible to cover a large distance going away from it.

 Usually when I have verbal tics I can say them under my breath or even just form the words with my mouth and I'm satisfied. When I get too high I have to them very loudly and precisely to feel all right. All of my body twitches and undulates in a concert of patterns. My whole brain is so utterly consumed with ticcing that the rest of the world deflects off me--I can barely participate in conversation because things people say to me flicker vaguely at the very edge of my awareness. and my whole brain and body are so occupied that I can't process or respond to anything said to me with anything but terse, short phrases that indicate minimal attention. Normal tic-relieving activities work--singing is a great help, as is dancing, or playing an instrument. In social settings I often read although this is hard--I am so energetic that I can barely take in words and I feel a desperate urge to move the whole time, but it keeps ticcing just barely at bay so I can avoid making a scene.

You might discover further characteristics vital to that object that you had been taking for granted earlier. [No matter how good of an essencer you are], this never hurts and is often helpful.]

I read O'Reilly's /The Ruby Programming Language/ cover-to-cover, playing around with the example code, did some Ruby Monk, and then branched out into studying code design (yay Sandi Metz!) and writing command line apps. I did Michael Hartl's Rails tutorial, worked through /The RSpec Book/, and started looking at the Rails internal code and poking around in gems. I developed a love of TDD. I wrote a Rails art gallery application for some visual artists I'm friends with (glittery.herokuapp.com), and a blog for myself with Sinatra (palelight.herokuapp.com). Right now I'm studying algorithm design, deepening my understanding of JavaScript and its ecosystem, and working on a couple of patches to submit to gems I've used. I know enough Ruby now to get a sense of just how much more the veterans know than me at this moment, which is an exciting place to be.

The dream sort of picks up back in the mid-size Texas town. Some of my friends on Twitter are coming to visit, but they're only going to be in town for a very short time, and the exact moments they'll be available are unpredictable. I want to make an Indian curry for them, and am strategizing with one of my housemates (a DC, a small-framed girl around my age with round wireframe glasses and short hair) about the best way to do this. Meanwhile, I'm furiously texting back and forth with my Twitter friends so we can all co-ordinate.

They would never shoot her unless she attacked them, though they shoot other leopards without hesitation.

It gets into the whole guess culture/ask culture thing--for me explicitness before implicit understanding defeats a sense of intimacy. I know that isn't true for everyone and when I've talked about this with asking-oriented people some of them have objected and been like, "No, not being explicit just wastes time and invites misunderstanding," and although I can't necessarily disagree across the board those people are definitely living in a different world from me. If we're all to set up a protocol for maximizing affection it seems like it ought to take this potential disconnect into account, and I'm not sure how--I don't really /want/ to tell other people what I want from them affectionwise because then I feel like I've set up an obligation or at least a system for them that is theirs to create--like I want someone else's expressions of affection for me to really be from them and not from me in a roundabout way. It can be hard to know the difference between "I want to be really nice to you but I haven't been sure what's best so thanks for telling me" and "Now I feel like I have to do x and y for you to consider my actions towards you really nice, even though I never would've done x and y of my own accord," or "Normally I would do this for someone I feel friendly towards but for you I'll find something else because now I know you don't like it," and "I guess you want to keep me at more of a distance than I thought."

Of course, in theory it doesn't have to be so all-or-nothing. It is possible that I could work on my "executive" goals for a "reasonable" amount of time on a given day and then use the rest of the day to pursue my more "visceral" goals. In practice, it has seemed thus far in my life that that is even less a part of my own proclivities than pursuing a single project continuously for the long haul. If it's difficult for me to sustain a continuous commitment to a project over the course of several weeks or more, it's wildly difficult for me to work intentionally on a number of different projects during a single day. I perceive each day as being "about" something, as having an overarching topic and/or goal. Developing the ability to "balance" my days in this manner would probably be beneficial, but such behavior is unprecedented in me, whereas I have worked on long-term projects continuously although it was very hard. I have some hope of learning to sustain daily work on a project in the long-term reliably, and I've noticed improvements in my ability to do that over time. I have less hope, at least right now, of acquiring the ability to switch tracks hour-by-hour reliably; I might get to a point where it seems more accessible but at the moment it seems very daunting and far away.

  He had straight brown hair about halfway down his ears and a well-maintained five-o-clock shadow, and he was wearing a light grey sweater over a black dress shirt and tight powder blue pants. His shoes were red. I wasn't quite sure what to make of him from his appearance, except to say that it gave the impression that he had thought hard about every aspect of it but in order to achieve a purposefully vague effect, one with dim, understated notes of dressiness and playfulness and maybe a subtle note of menace. It did not position him obviously in any particular cultural area.

Both pieces follow a unique logic that, though it may be more accessible than, say, Webern, are incredibly radical and established new ways of thinking about composition; the blending of highly disparate and compartmentalized ideas into a cohesive whole on all levels is flawlessly executed and brilliant, as is Strav.'s use of heavy levels of dissonance without necessarily sounding grating, harsh, or very explicitly so unless it is clearly intended;

In Texas, conservative state legislators rammed through a draconian bill of abortion restrictions that is likely to close nearly all of the abortion clinics in the state. The bill was unable to pass the bill during the legislature's regular session because it lacked the required consent of two-thirds of the legislators to be brought to the floor for a vote. In response, the governor called two special sessions, intended to be used to vote on emergency legislation that would have immediately catastrophic consequences if it could not be passed, to bring the bill to a vote, and suspended the two-thirds rule in the second session so the bill only needed a simple majority to be brought to the floor after it was filibustered in the first session. During the special sessions the Capitol building was flooded with furious protestors who were barred from speaking, thrown from the House and Senate chambers, and even beaten by State Troopers during a peaceful sit-in. Infamously, tampons were prohibited from being brought into the Senate Gallery during the second special session under supposed fears that they could be used as "projectiles," although concealed firearms were still allowed.

"YES! I actually had a conversation a few days ago with Rod Russell, Zachary Ossefort's dad, in which we both agreed that Hemingway's brevity makes the emotional content of his stories, namely the desperation and constant loneliness, even amongst friends, of the Lost Generation, having had the vast majority of their faith in their ideals smashed to bits by WWI, viscerally palpable. Many more flowery writers seem to set up a kind of barrier between you and the emotional content of the scene portrayed with their burdensome language, in which you intellectually understand how the scene feels but do not feel that way yourself; Hemingway seems just the opposite, searing right past the cold intellect and straight into the heart. What is not to love, indeed!

Athleticism -- your health and physical prowess. Someone with high Athleticism is coordinated, strong, has lots of endurance, and rarely gets sick. A very high score implies a professional athlete or someone with an obsessive devotion to fitness. A very low score implies someone who eats poorly and rarely gets out of the house; characters with low Athleticism are likely very thin or very fat.

All the best,
 C. Str.'s work has been dominated by a marked subjectivity that has made it idiosyncratic; I mean to argue that he was never a "true" naturalist, or if he was, it was a highly unusual one, and that his attraction to naturalism and positioning of himself as one may have been more of a social effort (to attract a wider european audience after his blasphemy trial and court zola whom he admired) than a genuine artistic effort, though he himself did appear to think himself at the heart of naturalism at one point.
and that's to put it pretty nicely
The nuts-and-bolts aspects of my writing process vary from piece to piece but I think there are consistent patterns in the way in which I set up those nuts and bolts. As I pawed at earlier I think of myself as an "experimental" writer in the literal sense that I approach writing as setting up an experiment and carrying it out to see what happens. I feel I have the highest level of conscious, intentional control over a piece at the very beginning, before I put any of the piece onto the page, because once I start really writing a different part of myself takes over and all my executive function can do is try to give suggestions while this goes on. As such the beginning of my process often involves me tweaking a basic concept or "set of conditions" sort of meticulously--I have a certain language mechanism I want to use for structure, or a certain progression I want to distill, or a setting for characters or something. I don't necessarily have a good idea of what piece something like this will generate, but I'll spend weeks often just turning it over, changing little parts of it, trying to gather material, and what I'm really trying to do is get it into a configuration where that other part of myself will suddenly generate a paragraph or two of the piece in response. When I've got it set up well enough this just happens, and it could happen anywhere--often if I get material like that in a place where I can't write immediately I'll think it over and over to myself so I have it in my memory. I'm often carrying around a few kernels like that sort of waiting until I feel comfortable enough to actually start writing them down, and either I eventually get the urge and start writing them or I start to feel they're not quite what I want and abandon them.
There is, of course, a catch-22 in this. The best way to get the kind of experience that allows to you to interact with the world in the way that I want is to start doing it. Inevitably you will make some people angry and upset and you have to deal with this. I think the issue that I have is that I don't want to have to do this. Learning that I failed to reach someone or brought them anger or sadness when I said something is like having a huge chasm open up under me. I feel I have failed at everything I try to be in life: kind, sharply analytic, and articulate.

This concludes the first section. Narratively, we get the verse's central image for the first time and move from conversation to explicit come-on. There is a large-scale pattern between spoken and lightly rhymed transitionary material and sung and densely rhymed important images, and a large-scale rhyming structure that is used in variation three times, in which a rhyme is set up, a different rhyme is set up within it, and then the lines are closed with material that answers the first rhyme.
6. They have heads. Their heads have a boxy, rectangular shape that ends in their nose and mouth. They have wide, squarish noses, large pink tongues, round black eyes set near the top of their head, roughly oval-shaped ears at the top of their head that may be quite rounded or almost come to a point, and sometimes smooth horns at the very top of their heads that stick out and often curve upwards. Their horns do not curl--that would suggest a ram's head, perhaps, instead of a cow's.

Edward Snowden, still stranded in the Moscow airport, has requested temporary asylum in Russia until he can claim permanent asylum in Venezuela, Bolivia, or Nicaragua, all of which have made offers. The U.S., desperate to prosecute him under the Espionage Act, has revoked his passport and put immense pressure on other countries not to assist him, threatening Latin American countries with economic penalties like the ending of trade preferences and saying that helping him "would put relations in a very bad place for a long time to come." That pressure also led to the grounding of Bolivian president Edward Morales's plane in Austria while flying from the Moscow airport after France, Spain, Italy, and Portugal refused to allow it to pass through their airspace under suspicions that Snowden was onboard. Morales was furious, saying to European countries, "We are no longer in the colonial period." Other South American nations were similarly outraged, seeing the grounding as a snubbing of South American sovereignty by Western powers. The Union of South American Nations, of which Bolivia is a member, held a summit last Thursday in anger over the grounding.

The rampancy of media consolidation in this country today presents a grim and undesirable trend. Americans looking to get the news are presented with an increasingly narrow mainstream of sources that present information of a tightly limited scope and perspective. There is nothing, of course, nothing inherently objectionable about the presence of that scope in the media landscape, but when it is the only one broadly available, it is unchecked by competing journalistic approaches that would hold it to the high standards we need as a free democratic nation. Major news outlets today often fail to cover stories that are unarguably significant, affecting millions of Americans, when they fail to fall within their narrow scope, and are increasingly featuring subjective commentary to the detriment of their journalistic objectivity.

I have been out-of-sorts in a very peculiar way since returning to this school. Yesterday I was most disturbed; my insomnia of several nights coupled with the steady wearing-down of break upon my character and the chain of events that followed it conspired to throw my consciousness into a state of disconcerting disarray. This reached a head the night before, while I was trying to sleep and increasingly distressed at my inability to do so, at which point my conception of the world became markedly different and frightening. At one point, I looked upon C.J.'s profile to wish him a confused and delirious "happy birthday" and upon leaving was beset by the text citing him as being in a relationship with you which I viewed as if 'twere new and unseen by me before, and was first perplexed, then terrified, then utterly defeated and rather ready to die. This was one of many instances in which I felt the sheer gravity of my situation as if I was an entirely new person suddenly shunted into it without any prior knowledge or time to be accustomed to it. I stared out my window and saw the trees and grass with utmost fear; I read text on the net and felt it came from a place utterly foreign to me of which I had no conception.

Programming has the perfect mix of technical and subjective. I love fields of endeavor like this, where you are drawn to develop a deep, subjective relationship with a complex matrix of relatively objective knowledge. The knowledge itself is static and needs you, with your subjective understanding, to animate it. When that happens, things get created. I compose a lot of music (I majored in music theory) and it feels almost identical to programming. I think of those areas as part of a larger toolset, even--when I want to make something for myself, I ask myself whether it would be better served by being an application, a piece of music, or a piece of literature. Sometimes it's two or all three (there's a lot to be gotten out of interactive literature--I think we've just scratched the surface). A lot of the applications I write for myself are interactive art pieces, and it's wonderful to me that programming is the way to produce them, because it's so pleasurable as an activity.

 At the end of the day I think it's a bit strange to call America "The Land of the Free." I think a better term might be "The Land of the Free to Compete." In America you are free to fight for whatever you want, but if enough other people want something else they are free to smash you to pieces. If one small stuffy Armani-style committee has built a vast crystalline structure with millions of people lined up unawares in the lattices, it can twitch its fingers here and there and the millions will twitch and jerk and smash you and all your friends and all your thoughts to pieces and it was really just the stuffy committee the whole time even though millions were involved. This might seem like a strange perversion of majority rule, but here in America you are free to fight for whatever you goddamn want, and that's the deal, love it or leave it.

Obviously on some level thinking intentionally or analytically about a piece of writing is in itself 'active' but less so than writing. At the same time I had to stop reading an essay I was in the middle of to do this (I need to start getting ready to leave the house soon so I'm presed for time) and felt pangs of guilt about stopping in the middle of it since it seemed important. No escape! Either I feel guilty about not writing my own thoughts out or I feel guilty about not reading something important.

If a cow makes sounds similar to these but slightly "off," we may recognize it as a standard cow that is sick or injured, but if it makes totally different sounds, it's an unusual cow. If it makes no sound at all, it can still be standard--we recognize that if it felt the need to make sounds, or had the ability, it would make cow sounds.

/Spem in alium/ has forty distinct voices that are set together in imitative counterpoint. As you listen to the piece, you can hear the voices passing musical ideas back and forth to one another and developing them over time. Each voice has a remarkable degree of independence, which allows the piece to change in texture radically many times as it moves forward. The piece's intense emotional power is generated through these contrasts as well as the incredible beauty of the melodic ideas--the sudden shifts from a quiet, distant statement of an unbelievably touching melody from far away to a whirling mass of brilliant voices.

Furthermore, that action doesn't inherently injure the professional well-being of artists at all. There is always a tangible, non-digital component to an artist's work if for no other reason than that a specific artist is a unique physical entity. Even if an artist makes and distributes their art using just a computer and generates no income from that aspect of their lives, they can appear in public, and for profit. Those who pay to attend such events purchase something of genuine value: that artist can only be in one place at one time. Their presence is actually scarce.

If you have no idea, work on impulse. Draw a line that looks pretty to you, play a few random notes, write down a scrap of dialogue you just heard someone in the other room say. Then take a look at what you just made and think about something that might be nice to go with it. If something comes to you, go with that and just keep doing that over and over. If what you made doesn't suggest anything to do, do something else on impulse next to it. Don't think about the first thing you made at all. Then look at them together and see if they suggest something to you. If not, make a third thing on impulse. Eventually, something will emerge to you that you can pursue.

Kafka's Split Heart: The Trial as Gnostic Parable
nathan?
A: It's a triple-portmanteau (za(ck)-anderson-song) made from my first two initials and last name (z. g. anderson) re-arranged. The reason for the musical theme (ha! ha!--it's not a musical theme at all, it's a linguistic one!) should be obvious.
The court of The Trial evokes a religious dread akin to Rudolph Ottos concept of mysterium tremendum as put forth in Das Heilige. This concept is characterized both by a daemonic&uncanny fear carrying with it an absolute overpoweringness that induces a humbling creature-feeling of ultimate inferiority in the receiver and a sense of the numinous force as wholly other, transcendent, and beyond the receiver of it (Otto, 13-28). Such things are said of the court. The court is everywhere and consumes all; it is stated directly that everything belongs to the court and indeed it is shown to be entirely without bounds (Kafka, 150). Furthermore, it possess a fierce and unstoppable wrath; it is a bureaucracy that is always vengeful but in an undisturbable state of eternal equilibrium, and if one disturbs it one will only ruin oneself as it will destroy one but itself cannot be changed (Kafka, 119-120). In this manner, it possesses Ottos absolute overpoweringness in full. To make matters worse, its wrath is completely arbitrary and defies logical apprehension, as the opinions of court officials are easily swayed by the slightest provocation and furthermore liable to issue decisions that convey the exact opposite of their professed opinion, thus making the courts wrath impossible to interface with on rational terms and placing one constantly in fear of attracting its literally deadly contempt which as far as one knows could happen at any time. This mirrors exactly Ottos conception of numinous wrath with regards to the concept of mysterium tremendum; he writes that the reason such a force inspires such dread is because its magnitude is entirely beyond man and it possess a wrathful potential that has no concern whatever with moral qualities&[instead it is] like stored up electricity, discharging itself upon anyone who comes too near. It is incalculable and arbitrary, using Yahwehs wrath in the Old Testament as an example. Given this, the court seems to be mysterium tremendum incarnate.

The most notable characteristic of Montessori schools is that they allow students a great degree of freedom of study and pace. Especially at an early level, they take the position that if students are given the materials to learn and shown how to use them, they will be naturally inclined to do so and will come to a love of learning that stems from within them, as opposed to having learning imposed on them externally in a manner that disavows them of agency. This teaches them to pursue learning on their own and associates feelings of personal achievment and progress with it from an early age, as opposed to the impressions that the public school system gives of learning being a cumbersome task imposed upon you by a societal framework that you are given no personal stake in.  Maria Montessori held that children have a natural desire to learn that remains present unless they are somehow taught to think negatively of it, and that if you give a child the resources to learn without that negative impression they will inherently do so. My experience to date causes me to agree with her.

The first line of the verse, "and then she started", is repeated twice and begun away from beat one (on the second beat instead), both of which serve to create an anticipatory effect. The repetition catches the listener's attention, piquing their curiosity about what it was the woman started to do (she has been mentioned briefly earlier in the song, contributing further to a sense of anticipation). Setting the verse away from beat one reduces its heaviness, creating a "hanging in the air" effect that is amplified by the sparse texture of the beat behind it and preparing the listener for the second "started".

The second "started" drops on beat one and delivers the image we were promised a bar earlier. This measure rhymes the first and fourth beats and the second and third; the rhyme on the fourth beat helps to further resolve the sense of anticipation created in the first bar by more throughly answering the first line, and the second and third beat rhyme creates a sense of momentum. We are being propelled through the intro into the verse's interior. This whole section is sung in a straightforward IV-V pattern that catches the ear but not aggressively, effective as an intro pattern.

Dream last night: Made out with a dream character I developed a crush on. Thin gal about my age and height, large eyes, rather bubbly in demeanor. We were lying together in and/or near the bed of an eggshell blue pickup truck. We were talking, and as we talked we gradually cuddled up with each other, then were talking with our faces very close together. The conversation assumed a higher- and higher-energy attraction undertone over time. Eventually we kissed each other almost without meaning to--we had gotten so close to that point that eventually we suddenly both forgot to hold ourselves back. We were both surprised by this (empathetic connection was heavy enough at this point that this emotion and the following ones were felt as viscerally common) but then were both pleased and then committed to actually just making out. We could feel one another falling for each other. I had the explosive, smashed-by-light feeling that accompanies the beginning of a new relationship.
The park resembled this scenery on a smaller scale and with more human influence--there were well-kempt ponds, some placards about the ecosystem, nice red-brown gravel paths. There were a few routes to downtown and the one I liked best was a small creekbed with a bit of water running in it. I walked along the stones being careful not to wet my shoes amongst a few other folks who were heading the same way.

In some ways (maybe a lot of ways) Eugene is proving to be unsatisfying. I don't regret coming if for no other reason than I have learned things and became more able (I think) through the struggle, but I actually dislike what I've seen of the culture here. It's very flat and schticky--people here seem less interested in genuine human connection than they are in fitting into some kind of played-out cultural role and keeping you at a distance. I haven't really encountered anyone at large here who seems at all unique--people seem inclined to bury their uniqueness behind an impenetrable screen. To some degree that dynamic exists everywhere of course but in Austin say you do sometimes see people who are uniquely dressed, or have what seems to be an idiosyncratic way of talking, or something, whereas here /everyone/ seems like an iteration of a stock type--they're a grungy raver, or a businessperson, or a bookish hipster, or something like that, and they make zero effort to reach you in any way beyond the surface of their "type." People are polite but in a detached way--I like it way less than the default jovial friendliness of Texas and even less than the default gruffness of the East Coast. People will smile at you and shake your hand and answer your questions and whatnot but never even put on the pretense of being genuinely pleased by your presence. Sometimes I go out and do outlandish things in public just to try to get some sort of an interesting reaction out of the people here but everyone just skims over my clothes and actions as if I'm doing nothing in particular.

 Two old men sit in a nice quiet park playing backgammon. They tap their long nails on the park table and drink their dark beer to help them feel casual, silently. The man in front--a fine-trimmed professor beard, beer foam reclining softly on his mustache--plays white. The man in back, with a clean-shaven lengthy gaunt face, pale blue eyes permanently on point, an unforgiving rancher, plays red. The man in front gets the first turn and a bit into midgame he takes a small but definite lead. He makes a die roll that splays tantalizing through his gut, giving him the feeling of a whole tree of paths to chase that roll into a win. He begins to line up the game's bits as play continues according to this suggested configuration.

I soon internalized the idea that being anything like a leopard was shameful; what first struck me as completely alien now took on the quality of an unchallengeable law. I turned my head if I saw toys for leopards in a store, I changed the channel if any shows with a leopard protaganist came on, and although I still saw some of my leopard friends from pre-school now and again I did my best to keep my friendship with any of them a secret. I have fond memories of birthday from this time in my life--having no close friends at school, I would have the leopard friends I was still in touch with over to celebrate, and for an afternoon I would be able to revel in the now-forbidden pleasure of spending time in a group in which I could act by instinct and be understood.

<b>Audrey Tautou</b> is Sara Matthews, a co-worker of Eldridge's and the one he is closest to. She considers herself a kind of sorceress, and though she is a good detective she is really focused on understanding every possible aspect of the Resonant Sphere and using that knowledge in her day-to-day life. She is highly perceptive, able to pick up on the intentions and feelings of others with a great deal of accuracy, and is able to have a better relationship with Eldridge than most due to her intuitive understanding of human emotion. She learned her detective skills on the job, having become a part of the Trumps Society after stumbling upon one of their cases in the course of her quest to understand the Resonant Sphere; they took her on immediately due to her already well-developed abilities, despite her having no instruction in detective work. Privately, she plays the violin, but rarely lets others hear her unless she is close to them. She also draws well, and is fond of depicting the visions she has in the course of her interactions with the Resonant Sphere. She is a Parisian native, the only one of the main characters to be so.

 Once long ago, in a faraway land, there lived a hot dog peddler. He would set up on street corners and hawk hot dogs from sunup to sundown. He loved his job and his cart--loved to fill the air around him with the smell of grilled pork from a hot fire, knew intimately the instant satisfaction brought to his customers by his product, had fond feelings for the green umbrella that kept him cool and dry and the untouchable immaculate white of his stand in the midst of a dirty city.

10. They are alive. Cows are animals--they move of their own volition, respond to stimulus, breathe, are warm, and so on. They are social animals, so they interact with each other and often form large groups. They eat plants, often grass. They have varying moods and can be content or frustrated. They don't like to feel pain. They may have sex. They may give birth. A cow that is not warm, not moving, and not breathing is probably dead, and is rapidly becoming no-longer-a-cow.

6. Standard cows have cow heads. This is another pretty necessary characteristic. If a cow lacks a head entirely, it's still a cow--just a headless cow--but if it has something else aside from a cow head, especially if it's a different head, it's probably cow-related but not a cow. It might seem like a hybrid of a cow and something else. We put a lot of a cow's "cowness" in its head, especially its face. If it has a head that's close to a cow head but with some slight variations--strangely-colored eyes, weird horns, unusual markings, or so on--we may see it as a deformed or injured cow, or maybe as a different bovid, such as a buffalo. 
What you have with Nick sounds really wonderful. Even if it doesn't last, he sounds like he's treating you really nicely and almost certainly wants to get closer to you than he is, no matter what he might've said about not wanting a girlfriend and not liking comitted relationships. There are a lot of guys who say that because they haven't really found anyone they clicked with in a long time, and they've just been drifting from lackluster person to lackluster person, or they've been hurt badly in the past or have some other reason to be afraid of commitment (like, for instance, a cold or angry relationship between their parents, or between their parents and them, when they were kids, or some political ideology about the nature of romance they adopted in their teens or early twenties and haven't let go of). In any case, he sounds like he really likes you and you might be able to change his mind. Of course, he may just be unwilling to date people for the long term at this point in his life, so I'm not saying you should proceed as if he is, but he also could very well find himself backpedaling on that once he gets to know you better. He also might leave when his work is done, too, regardless, and there may not be much you can do about that. But even if it's just for a while, having someone to confide in and spend time who's nice to you and that you really like is priceless. I'd say try not to think too much about the future and just live in the moment; you can't really know how everything will play out and the whole situation might be completely different in a couple of months, so it probably makes the most sense just to enjoy what you have and cross what bridges you have to when they come.

Just awoke. I had a number of dreams last night; they may all have been part of one large dream, since I'm not entirely sure where each one ends and the other begins, and they involve some of the same characters and settings, but right now I'm intuitively separating them into three different dreams. 
had my top hat on and was walking around upstairs with it; turned to look at myself in the mirror and saw that I apparently had the head of one of the other guys at the party; was super-taken-aback by this and deduced that I had to still be dreaming for that to be possible (never done that before!)

I have an apartment now. It is in South Egremont, MA, in back of an antiques shop, and has a flower garden outside. I really like how the lease has a "Quiet Enjoyment" clause, specifying that as long as I do everything I am supposed to do, I "shall and may peacefully and quietly have, hold and enjoy" my apartment. Yes, indeed.

And, everything with your father saying awful things to you and discovering awful things about that adult from your childhood and not being able to reach your friend--that just seems unreasonable, especially with so many non-social shitty things for you to deal with; it seems like you'd feel like you were running out of people to turn to in those circumstances, even if there were folks around. At least your brother's all right, but of course that wouldn't even have been an issue if he hadn't gotten in a car wreck, I guess. I don't even know what your relationship with that brother is like, so maybe that's not even relevant.

gabi's hatred of "gay shit" is directly connected with her fear of weakness; "gayness" is in a manner of speaking an admission that one is unable to "buck up" and make themselves function normally and thus is an unacceptable concession; furthermore, in a larger sense, "gayness" glorifies a certain kind of "weakness"/emotional vulnerability/etc. that triggers gabi's fear response in that situation

It might seem curious that most of my relationships in my life so far have been with women, given this. I've actually dated men twice, but I've mostly kept those relationships private. Beyond that, I went to a very small college; male students whom I could date long-term I could generally count on two hands. In a pool that small it's hard to find a mate. I did have an overwhelming crush on a boy there as a freshman complete with elaborate romantic dreams and lots and lots of pining. To my disadvantage, I didn't fully realize this until the summer, and when I returned to school in the fall I found that he had changed as a person in ways that cooled my interest in him. I've only been in a relationship once since graduating; along similar lines, the social groups I've run in since then have consisted mostly of straight people.

As a side note, I feel just the same way as you about expressions of general social appreciation! I'm always really gratified when someone else tells me that they had fun with me or that they liked something I invited them to get involved with or whatnot and I'm trying to do my best in general to let other people know when I feel that way about things they've done with or for me. I know there are people who feel that even that sort of thing is uncomfortable, though, in that if someone thanks them for something nice they did they feel like a frame has been constructed where that person is in some way repaying them for it and they don't want the other person to feel that it had any strings attached and might even feel a bit put off that the other person would assume it did. I struggle with that stuff when it comes to some kinds of favors--I'll initiate a long "Oh, no, you don't need to do that" "Oh no but it's nothing" kind of exchange, which makes me feel a lot more comfortable but I know can frustrate someone who doesn't feel the need to do that. I don't really know what to do about that--I do feel icky accepting some favors without having an exchange like that first but I don't want to force someone who doesn't feel that way to do something irritating to them as a prerequisite for doing something nice for me. Part of me feels like those folks ought to sympathize with folk of my ilk and another part of me feels like I should try to get myself not to do it for their sakes.
Visual art is /so complex/! I am feeling a bit of field remorse almost--should I have been a visual artist? Well, no, music is complex too in being sort of more "essential"--it deals with extremely fundamental structures that gives it greater complexity in other areas. I am interested in the mitigation of personal experience through fundamental strata and the relationship therein. Visual art seems focused almost exclusively on portraying relatively personal internal experience fairly directly, albeit in symbolic terms--it is perhaps the art form that comes closest to capturing the experience of being physically alive. Literature sort of captures the experience of being emotionally alive, while music captures the experience of being intellectually alive. Of course, all of these areas talk to each other and each art form deals often closely with all three--but it seems like at the very end/beginning of each of those modes that fundamental aspect of experience is present lensing everything else.

josef k.'s unwillingness to not be drawn into interaction with the law or leave parallels in some way Otto's concept of numinous fascination; however, additional points should likely be made; this fascination however reflects a "good" in the holy that draws one to it; josef k's eventual death at the hands of the law may reflect this:
The Trumps Society, re-named for a gained awareness of the Resonant power of the Tarot and formerly known as Barthe's Beuareau, are an adhocractic PI firm formed by Simon Barthe in 1906, based in Paris and mainly consisting of ex-patriots. They have almost entirely consisted of six members since their inception; the original group had six members and when one member would leave or died another would quickly be found to fill their place. Charles Williams later wrote <i>The Greater Trumps</i> first inspired by a vague awareness of the Society. They began as a regular detective agency, but after being hired by the Grael Group, they remained permanently attached to it while maintaining their technical independence, primarily solving cases of concern to the Group but also solving external cases presented by everyday figures that appear to have some attachment to the interests of the Group. They pursue cases in which some figure or society has both attained an awareness, either consciously or unconsciously, of the Resonant Sphere and has used it, intentionally or unintentionally, to manipulate the fabric of reality in a way detrimental to the interests of the group or humanity as a whole. These case are frequently of a beautiful and strange nature--if they are horrible it is only by incident, as people, including those most directly in touch with the Sphere, may die due to its intensely non-human nature, but that was rarely the point of what happened as it is in an ordinary murder, as such deaths that occur when contacting the Sphere are frequently incidental. This is almost inevitably true unless one person was using the Sphere to murder another, something that rarely happens within the vantage point of the Society, as this almost always occurs within the boundaries of the Grael Group and is such outside the reach or scope of the Society.

Manning, through /WikiLeaks/, showed the world the "Collateral Murder" video in which soldiers in two helicopters opened fire on unhostile and mostly unarmed people in Iraq, killing two Reuters war correspondents, one of whom they fired on after he was on the ground wounded, and killing the father of two children who were injured in the attack as they stopped in a van to take the wounded correspondent to a hospital, among others. Manning was originally arrested for revealing this alone. With the help of /WikiLeaks/, /The New York Times/, /The Guardian,/ and /Der Spiegel/, he also brought to light the Afghanistan and Iraq war logs, revealing thousands of unreported civilian deaths at the hands of the soldiers of the U.S. and allies, systematic unwillingness by U.S. authorities to investigate allegations of torture, rape, and murder by Iraqi police and soldiers, and continuous examples of torture of detainees even well after Abu Ghraib, several of whom were tortured to death. Finally, he revealed the contents of thousands of diplomatic cables, showing the U.S. spying on top U.N. officials and diplomats, national governments colluding illegally with multinational corporations for mutual gain, and widespread corruption and nepotism under the authoritarian royal family in Tunisia, inspiring the revolution there that then sparked the Arab Spring. In light of all this, Manning was recently nominated for a Nobel peace prize by Mairead Corrigan-Maquire, founder of the Northern Ireland Peace Movement, who won the prize in 1976.

I am getting memories of earlier in the dream, which seemed before all this to be a gigantic trek alone through wetter, greener Central-Texas-like wilderness. Looking out over tall limestone cliffs, walking over smooth white stones in large verdant creekbeds, etc. It was all with a destination in mind--perhaps the city where the rest of the dream transpired.

Hooray! We've essenced a cow. Someone unfamiliar with cows, or who wanted to model a cow, could consult this for a roadmap, although it would probably help them to see some illustrations at least. As with many sensory objects, to truly understand a standard cow you probably need to encounter one--truly describing the essence of a standard cow in as much detail as possible, so that someone who has never encountered a living, healthy cow would be able to convince others easily that they had, would likely take at least a book. Understanding a cow well enough to create an unusual cow, or depictions of a cow, may not require this. If you are familiar with standard cows, this gives you everything you need to suggest a standard cow, an unusual cow, or a different object with some cow features, and to know the specific ways in which adding, subtracting, and modifying the features of your object will bring it nearer or further from standard cowhood.
ultimately everything is relative. when I said life was about tricking yourself I was right. eventually there's a point at which you don't care about anything at all but are cripplingly sad and at that point the only thing to do really is kill yourself. if you care about the people around you then being told people care about you is consolation. if not then there's no reason to bother. it's sort of the same principle with getting help; if nothing makes you happy enough to inspire you to continue living then there's no reason to do that. ultimately that is where I'm at right now. I'm very tired and so I think I'll go to bed but tomorrow at night I'll bundle up some to prevent the risk of frostbite and then cover myself in ice so I'm wet and go to sleep in Siberia. if I do this early enough I ought to have enough time so that I'll die of hypothermia. I would do it right now but I'm so tired and out of sorts that I can't think straight enough to do anything but go to bed and finish this tomorrow. I know technically if I don't care about anything I ought to disregard tiredness and just go and do it and plus if I'm already sleepy even better and so on and so forth but I am not thinking logically right now; my emotions have entirely overpowered my reasonable faculties and thus the latter is hopeless to affect any change in the former. anyway this is an especially good way because I don't risk brain damage if discovered. I don't want to jump in the lake because it has this essence of filth about it to me and I have these issues tying in with OCD about it and don't want to be in it. sleeping in Siberia is nice and peaceful anyway and hours vs. minutes isn't really a big difference anyway especially if I'm asleep.

I think that what makes adulthood worthwhile, at least for me, is the massive increase not only in your independence but also in the scope that you are able to view the world in as you move out of childhood through adolescence and into adulthood. When I was a kid, I thought the world was terribly lacking in richness, and spent much of my time far off in elaborate fantasies; I described myself as an escapist at nine and regularly wished I could find some portal or hidden passageway or something of that sort into another universe that had more to offer. As I grew older, and was able to roam more rangily, I began to have experiences that held the kind of fascination, magnitude, and grandeur that I had longed for and been unable to find as a child. I also found that the increase in introspective capacity allowed me to solve notable problems of mine and notice ones I was previously unaware of. Both of these continue to get more and more true the older I get, so that each year I have thought I was better off than in the last one, even in years when I was relatively unhappy on the whole.

Tim Hecker likes to create textures where there are a number of layered voices that each have a unique tempo--a fast-moving, thumping, but extremely quiet bassline, a soaring melody that moves at a moderate pace, and a background wash of noise that undulates at an extremely slow tempo are all common elements. Often they turn on and off at different times (larger-scale periodic activity), so one that was buried in the background will suddenly emerge in the front. All this gives his music a powerful sense of forward motion without a "beat".

I appreciated how due to our lighthearted approach we could address political and social issues on campus that had very serious connotations for a lot of people with a casual and easygoing touch and still do justice to the issues at stake and our feelings about them.

We walked as if we were going somewhere in particular--Karl and [Ganesh] didn't even look at all the people we passed, or any of the buildings, and just kept their eyes straight ahead, fixed on an imaginary destination. I followed a few feet behind and glanced at the face of every stranger I could get away with.

Figuring the person who owns the house and car might not have a stereo and is inside the house using their car to listen to music, I approach the front door to knock. As I near the stoop, a group of chickens run across it following a rooster and circle around towards the back of the house. After knocking on the door, I receive no response.

 My boyfriend's name is Carlo. He likes to imagine that he is Puerto Rican, but is he from Wyoming, where there are no Puerto Ricans. He has perfectly smooth hands, and when I stare into his palms, I see nautilus fractals, twisting down forever into empty space. He strokes my blonde hair, and I get goosebumps all down back of my neck. I like to imagine that we will get married, on a perfectly white yacht, so white that it will blind the beachgoers.

This feeling has not entirely dissipated. It does so in your company, but otherwise I frequently feel the room I'm in is on the verge of collapsing (in the sense that it will fly apart entirely and cease to exist, rather than simply cave in, and in this way this feeling applies equally to the outdoors) and that I myself am held together only by threads so tenuous and hell of wispy a spider covets. I balk at normal conversation and find myself walking away from folk in a most hideous of tizzies shouting about incomprehension. Today, in my Romantic Music class, I found myself staring out the window at the branches outside and feeling unshakably as if they were bearing down upon me and would tear me apart; I consoled myself, as I often do, by ruminating on the guns the security guards carry and the knowledge that in a moment of true desperation they are present and could be possible to use. I am aware that this is a rather disturbing form of consolation, but it is too effective to shirk (depite that I love 2).
It can be hard to diagnose something like that in children, who are generally impulsive and don't distinguish as strongly between their actions and their desires. However, I don't think that means we shouldn't try. If I had been diagnosed and given treatment in childhood, I think my entire adolescence would've been infinitely easier.

So, I think you've had a good run, definitely, but you've gotta know when to step aside, too.

If you just stick around, all you'll have for mammals are those little shrews and things running around, and none of this awesomeness can ever happen.

In this manner, Kafka's thought shows a distinctly Gnostic flavor that is reflected strongly in the sort of religious imagery and metaphor present in The Trial; Kafka was familiar with Gnostic thought and it is not unlikely that his simultaneous interest between it and Judaism produced the foundation for much of his ontology here (Sokel, 7). To begin with, he professed a belief that death was liberation from life, the dawn of a knowledge which corresponded exactly to the meaning the Gnostics gave the term, (Sokel, 8), and a sentiment linking strongly with the conclusion both of the chaplains parable and The Trials conclusion as a whole:

I live in a big mansion
I'm really lonely, honestly, though less for lack of company (I go to sundry parties and shows) than for misanthropy--I jus' seem to knee-jerk hate nearly everyone new I meet, and my stunning lack of internal regard for the well-being of my fellow people is as mouth-frothing as always (I'm nice as pudding to most folks unless they cross some sort of a...line, but that doesn't stop me spending all day damning th' hell out of them--how on Earth does that work, damning th' hell out of somebody? I guess I know as well as anyone). On that note, I read "Everything that Rises Must Converge," by Flannery O'Connor, today and reveled in every second of it--what a damn good story. How proper! Anyway, I'm not really sure what to do about this except to keep meeting new people, but a'course that has the double-edged quality of continually cementing my pessimism about finding people I get along with. It doesn't help that every time I do meet someone I like pretty well they turn out to be so remarkably busy as to cause making good friends with them to be impossible (seriously--the ratio of folks whom I've met relatively recently and like for whom this is true to those thus qualified for whom it is not is 4:0--hideous). I guess I can always make friends with the lake, who has all the time in the world.
The physical world is already full of examples of this. Bands can profit through shows and merchandise. Authors can profit through tours and sales of physical books. Filmmakers can profit through screenings and panel appearances. Visual artists can profit through sales of originals and commissions. The list goes on through all the artistic careers.

 we think of femininity as being about beauty, passivity, submissiveness, cooperation, smallness, empathy, soft-spokenness, personal sensitivity, aversion to conflict, and so on
When I say "visceral," I mean "purely emotional" as opposed to like "emotional and intellectual." I think sometimes when we first listen to a piece, we get the sense that we don't really "know what it's doing" but we maybe really, really dig it--like we'd be hard-pressed to explain much about its structure or techniques or whatever but we can say stuff like "It was really fast-paced and energetic, and the melody was really pretty." When you listen to it more, you start to notice more technical stuff. You might realize there's a really cool drum fill in the middle of one of the verses, or that there's a subtle key change. In intricate music you might start to pick out variations of a motive or an interesting harmonic progression or something. If you keep listening with the intention to try to follow the piece as well as possible, eventually you can consciously hear all the moments of the piece--they don't just run together into a wash of emotional color without fine details like they may do on first listen. I'm not saying everyone absolutely will always have this experience, but I think anyone that's into music is at least capable of it, and I've never talked to anyone who's listened to a strong piece that way and felt they enjoyed it less after a lot of close listening or that they felt it wasn't music for them anymore. I dunno, we might have different but equally legitimate ideas about what makes something more or less like music, I guess.

People have been talking a lot in the past century or so about what gender exactly is. I think gender is an art medium, like literature or sculpture. Like any art medium, it is similar to the others but different in key ways. Gender is different in ways that make it the worst art medium ever. You may not necessarily feel this way right now--you may be pretty happy with your body of work--but I think it's definitely true regardless of who you are. I've set up the following metaphor to illustrate why:

He was an Inkling (along with C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien), and as such he discusses his ideas in a Christian context near the end of the book. If that's your bag, that section is probably desirable, but if it's not, the ideas at the heart of the book are secular and you can really take or leave it. Similarly, the book is sometimes packaged contemporarily as being focused on Christian spirituality, which isn't really true and wasn't how the book was presented when it was first published. Barfield also promotes the work of Rudolf Steiner at a few points, who had some similar ideas but I think is rather nutty by comparison and not as wholly great a thinker as Barfield claims. Those points are parenthetical and passing them by doesn't hinder the book at all.

When I bring them to my face, it's as if the water isn't there; I can see it, but if I try to drink it, it's like it's just air. I pour the only-visual water in my hands down the sink and try to drink straight from the tap, which causes me to wake up.[/LD]
 In the middle of the page was a circle with three spheres inside of it. Tendrils snaked out from it in all directions, twisting themselves into smaller circles with smaller spheres in them, which spawned their own tendrils, with their own circles--on and on, filling all the space, off towards edges of the page and as far down as the eye could make out. But around the borders of the page, the tendrils squirmed into the heads of a bunch of different breeds of dog.

There is a phrase I use frequently that hasn't yet become conventional, and for the sake of clarifying my speech, I'd like to explicate it. It's "surface scattering". I'll often talk about a certain direction of thought as "scattering on the surface". This is to indicate that I think it's mistaking the surface of whatever it's trying to understand for the thing's heart. This is easy to do since, touchingly (hahaha--but, really, puns aside, the patterns in this are often touchingly beautiful), the surface of a thing reflects its heart. In fact, a thing's heart is often most explicitly visible on its surface--but in an unpredictable fashion! You cannot understand a thing's heart from an understanding of its surface--you must use the surface as a guidepost to the heart and follow the path. Only then will you understand the mechanics by which the heart contacts the surface. Sadly, a thing's surface is a thing in itself, with its own surface and interior, and the path from that surface to that interior tends to be shorter and more obvious, making it attractive. There's no inherent harm in analyzing the surface if you know what you're doing, but if you do that analysis and think you're getting to the heart, you'll fill your container with the wrong substance. It may be so similar to the right substance that you don't notice your whole life, even if its subtle differences are fatal to your device. Tragic!

Right away, I lift off of my bed into the air and hover near the ceiling.

It reminds me of a room used to wash clothes and store linens in a daycare or small primary school.
After we got back, Zachary decided to hunker down and do transcription for the rest of the day since he'd been putting it off throughout the weekend. Rosie and I began to talk rather heavily--she was wearing a shirt that said "Dixie Rose / Southern by the Grace of God" which I asked about wryly ("Do you consider yourself a Dixie Rose? Do you feel Southern by the Grace of God?") and turned out to have belonged to her great-grandfather from Ohio, which spurred on a heavy conversation about family dynamics. We talked about how he had recently died, and how that was sad for her as she barely knew him and wished she had known him better, and then began discussing the ways in which her family fit together: how her mom's parents were divorced and their sides of the family didn't get along, how her mom and dad had met, how her mom's parents had gotten pregnant on accident when her grandmother was 15 and her grandfather was 17 and split up a few years later after a rough marriage, how her great-grandmother collects teapots, has written the names of the people who will inherit the teapots when she dies on the bottoms of all of them (some of them will go to Rosie!), and once sent Rosie a gift late because she put Rosie's address in a teapot for safe keeping and then forgot which teapot she had left the address in, and such. Around this time, Zachary told us that our conversation was really distracting, and asked that we either start doing solitary, non-conversational activities in the room or go somewhere else. Rosie said that she wanted to make muffins, and invited me to come to Noyes with her to do that and keep talking.
afterwords she put the pouch on the floor and the woman wanted me to move it into the bedroom as well but when I picked it up it started to leak blood from the top and I realized it wasn't fully sealed; I told her I was going to transfer it to a ziplock baggy and did so with a box of them I found in the bedroom

He sat in the back, amongst the drums from last night's 34 show, while Rosie and I shared the passenger seat up front. Elliot decided to stay in the car while we shopped. We took a while in the grocery store, each of us wandering around individually and intersecting every once in a while. Zachary discovered that cans of Chef Boyardee food were a dollar a pop, so we both bought a few. I also bought some rice and lentils and a big container of oats. While I checked out, I accidentally spilled some lentils on the self-checkout counter, and wanted to clean them up, but there were two folks in line behind me who seemed eager to go and I didn't want to slow them down.

standing on a beach, very cold outside and ethereally windy (the wind always comes towards me from the front and does not seem to have travelled over the ocean; it is sort of two-dimensional, as this vision is in general, though not really two dimensional--it has some characteristics of two-dimensional space and some characteristics of three-dimensional space), sand is perfectly black with large grains, there is a void behind me, sand, water, and sky stretch on infinitely perpendicular to me, it is the blackest night, and the water is fairly translucent, so that it appears to be almost black too but also gains some luminescence from the starlight, which is very bright because the sky is covered in impossibly bright pale cold blue stars; as the piece progresses the procession of the equinoxes takes place right in front of my eyes--I can see a huge frame stretching half-transparent across the sky and turning, and can also see at the same time (in a way that is physically, dimensionally impossible, because it is a sight of things moving like the stars and the frame that are at the same time perfectly still, and also the frame moving is not exactly the same frame as stretches across the sky but at the same time is, or together they form a single unified object, but in any case this form of sight is of course extremely easily and naturally done in that space) the progression through the ages as the stars twist and rotate and the frame moves so that the galactic road opens and closes, and the ages start and end with the start and end of each phasing section in the piece; sometimes, as I settle into the vision, the zodiac sign associated with the age will flash on the sky, in a different position each time, performing a different action, as a still, glowing picture the same color as the stars, in sync with some of the musical rhythms, at a very rapid pace, maybe several times a second (as the rhythms occur)

Consider humpback whales. They're mammals, but like all cetaceans, they live in the ocean! They evolved from land mammals so I think that's amazing. If that's not enough for you, they sing long, intricate songs to each other in a theme-and-variations sort of style. Maybe that's too abstract for you to get into. Think about this: a small group of them can, using synchronized hunting techniques, devour a whole huge school of fish in a couple of seconds. As a voracious predator, I'm sure you can appreciate that.

I wanted to tell y'all all this for a number of reasons. I think it's important for queer people to be out if they can and I've just been too afraid in the past. More specifically, though, I'm coming back to Austin and some of the feelings of alienation I've had here in the past are because I haven't been open about my queerness. As far as I know y'all are mostly straight and there have been times I've felt sort of out of place in social gatherings. I haven't been able to speak up for myself in the past without outing myself.

What do I call a cup? I know that a cup is, fundamentally, a vessel for drinking liquids. However, it is part of a larger group of such vessels, such as jugs, flasks, and canteens, and so has some characteristics that specialize it. Comparing it to other such objects, I can see that it is differentiated from them in two ways--functionally, the only abstract distinction, and morphologically, the only sensory distinction. It's not only a vessel for drinking liquids, it's a vessel for drinking liquids immediately, and it's distinguished from its cousins primarily by its shape. A cup could be made of all sorts of materials that other drinking vessels might also be made from, but for me to know it is a cup it must:

And, actually, while we're on the subject of predation, my own species has really made predatory activity into an art form, if I may say so myself. We're so apex-predator-y that we kill and eat other apex predators in droves. Did you know that we kill around 73 million sharks each year? They have tasty fins. Also we just kill them on accident a lot of the time while we're trying to kill and eat gajillions of other fish, even though we're totally adapted to life on land, because fish are delicious. Going the other direction, something like ten people get killed by sharks each year. We're playing a crazy game. And that isn't even getting into farming.

Subtle, cancer-causing pathogens like HPVs are, I think, less generally frightening both because they dont also cause acute, short-term deadly illness or environmental poisoning and because there isnt much of a question about their presence. Since we know that HPVs are nothing new and common throughout the world, its easier to come to the conclusion that theyre not worth worrying about very much because life as we know it clearly goes on anyway and has for millennia in their company, even though deaths from cervical cancer alone in one year outstrip the number of deaths from all radiation accidents in history. Accidental, widespread radiation exposure is an aberrant occurrence that wasnt an issue pre-WWII, so its much easier to feel that its hard to say how much of a threat radiation exposure really poses and that it might be far more dire than is usually claimed.

The numinous is here in full as it is in The Trial; Kafka's feeling of subservience to an absolute but incomprehensible force is mysterium tremendum in kind. In Description of a Struggle, Kafka describes this sense of personal duty to an unknown superpersonal power, portraying a man who does not think of his personal life or his personal thoughts, but rather it seems to him as though he were living and thinking under the compulsion of a family which in its own right&had superabundance of light and thought, but which for he, according to a law unknown to him, represents a formal necessity. Because of that unknown family and those unknown laws, he cannot be released (Sokel, 4; Kafka, 283). Furthermore, this is not the only religious force present in Kafka's thought; he has fascinans as well, but, naturally, separate and in conflict with mysterium tremendum, what Sokel describes as a double bind in the most literal sense if religio means bond or bind (4). Kafka portrays this metaphorically in Wedding Preparations in the Country, writing of someone who is bound around the neck by two chains fastened to heaven and earth respectively: 
Snowden, with the help of journalist Glenn Greenwald, documentarian Laura Poitras, and the newspaper /The Guardian/, among others, revealed that the NSA has been intercepting and collecting email, phone conversation metadata, social network activity, video and voice chat, and more, without warrants, from over a billion people in dozens of countries, including the U.S., with the help of allied foreign intelligence services and prominent tech corporations. He acquired the documents proving this while employed as an NSA-contracted systems analyst. He's said that he identifies as a patriot and has nothing against the U.S. government, but rather believes these sorts of programs are dangerous to a democracy and wants the public to be able to decide whether or not they're desirable.

I guess in general it seems to me like a protocol like this only works if you generally feel that more explicitness is better and you should generally be verbally clear about what you want and don't want, and I think that's only really true if you're a certain kind of person. Some people seem to argue that it's objectively the best way to behave, and I think that fails to acknowledge how this stuff isn't necessarily about like abstract value systems but more like basic personality material. I'm definitely all for more affection in platonic relationships and I love it when my friendships are super-affectionate, but I guess I have a hard time feeling comfortable with any sort of standardized system as people have discussed so far for making that happen, and when it comes to romantic relationships the huge variance from person to person in implicitness/explicitness needs, similarity/difference from platonic relationships, etc. would seem to require a completely different flavor of governing structure if it's even possible and beneficial to create such a thing on a scale that could encompass human romantic needs in general.

I think the deepest sort of strength is the sort that allows you to expose your most vulnerable places, be attacked in that position, and continue to thrive. The ability to repel people from ever seeing or touching those places seems trifling by comparison. In the interest of developing that strength, which has been small in me, I've decided to write here.
plans have been largely unsuccessful due to the following problems: funding is very limited and frequently not budgeted out for the scope of the entire project (often just for 3-5 yrs., when recovery efforts usually take longer), monitoring efforts are often misguided (focal species is centered on at the cost of ignoring associated species) and subject to taxonomic bias (birds, mammals), birds and mammals are generally focused on to a greater extent than other species, among other factors

4. Standard cows have a roughly square-shaped body, with the head at the top front, the tail at the top back, and a pair of legs at the front and back bottom. This is a pretty necessary characteristic. If a cow's body is slightly different from this, it can be a real cow (for instance, some Brahman cattle have a strange, wavelike hump), but if it is more than a bit different, it's a very unusual cow, probably imaginary, and if it lacks a body at all (if it's just a head, legs, and tail in a pile, say), we need strong other cues to still see it as a cow (it must be alive, for instance, which is the only other way to connect the cow parts together to make a larger whole) and it's still very unusual. If it lacks a body and isn't alive, it's not a cow--at best, it's just cow parts.

Getting in the habit of doing art implies a demanding religious practice, one that is hard to follow. Art asks you to let go of yourself, without fear or concern or preening. Even if you spend a lot of time on a single piece, it must be an automatic, reflexive process, not the result of anxiety. Similarly, you should not cut a piece short because it bothers you. It can be disturbing and unflattering to see yourself reflected back at you. To really get something out of doing art you have to work through that. You are not worth more or less than anybody else.

It seems funny how losing stuff seems like it's such a harmlessly absentminded thing, like it shouldn't matter that much because it's so easy to do, and so you get in this mindset where it's like the worst that could happen is you could lose your keys for a bit and have to spend twenty minutes tracking them down; I think it's so sort of cosmically unjust and disproportionate that an action (or, really, inaction) so slight could have such dire consequences, especially on an emotional level. I hope someone turns it in; even if it was technically your "fault," it just seems unfair.

I think I would probably still study programming because of my personal interest in it and my visions of projects that require it. I don't think I would do it as quickly. My default tendency thus far in my life seems to be to jump around from project to project week by week; I do finish things, but often not in a direct beginning-to-end fashion. Rather, I'll do a third of a project, move to something else, do some pure research for a while, come back and do another third of that project, maybe go on to finish it or maybe abandon it, etc. My enthusiasm for anything as specific as a single project waxes and wanes with the days and weeks.

Soon all the beautiful cream moths would cover all the lights in the whole college and it would all decay in the dark and control of the school would pass to the moths. Fauns danced just out of view in the nearby wood, leading plump German children singing into pit traps. The strong winds carrying the night in whipped my skirt around like hung canvas, but I'd been smart enough to put on thick knit tights, beloved art-deco-wallpaper tights, and they kept me just warm enough not to complain.
