i can go outside, i would need to put all my cold weather stuff on i guess

i don't want to hang out there too long though

how long do you think it'll take?

i'm probably going to take off on the earlier side--like I was thinking around 12:30?

okay

I don't really want to go outside for half an hour

oh okay so we could still sort of interact

okay

how long do you think you'll be gone?

you use this sort of thing to shave with standard ol' razor blades

oh yeah you filmed me once

you could wrap them in tissue paper?

with rubber bands

or wrap them in cloth and tie a knot

you could put them each in spare socks and tie the ends too

that thing looks really useful! is it just a small hard case you can use to store little fragile things?

that's really awesome! what brand is it? pelican?

yeah, is it airtight? that's awesome--and it would keep glass safe too

yeah wow that looks crazy

those are the extra-intense pipe cleaners too

the ones with the red spines on the side

they have extra-intense bristles

weed resin is wild stuff

it's so sticky and almost solid--it's like pitch or tar or something

i didn't, i sort of figured i'd give my respiritory system a break--but yeah i could--i don't know if it would be a good idea for me to use your vape though, i would make you sick i bet--oh then it wouldn't really matter

yeah i dunno--i've use my vape a few times in the last week and it's relatively okay, i'm just so tired of having laryngitis :(

i haven't been able to talk for like a week it gets so old

i think a week by now?

i'm mostly over the flu but that's like the last thing to go always

like when i got pneumonia, i got better except for that and that stuck around for like another whole week aftewards

oh dang

i mean i had pneumonia for a month i think

wow--i think a week is normal flu course for me

you must have a robust immune system

wow that's wild

usually if i get the flu i'm bedridden for 3-5 days

yeah i seem to get particularly ill for some reason just like in general

i get sick like 3-4 times a year--i hear some people say they hardly ever get sick at all though

oh okay

yeah i don't usually get sick this badly--usually it's just colds and stuff

i haven't been this sick probably since i got pneumonia

yeah--that was /way/ /way/ worse

i got depressed at a different time--but yeah it's possible, i was very stressed

yeah i was generally stressed out, i'm sure that didn't help, yeah

i wonder that every day

but people seem not to? yeah, they keep themselves on a more straightforward track

if i say that stuff out loud to most people they're usually like, "yeah, yeah, I guess, I dunno"--you get the impression that they just don't think about that much

like they get the sentiment but they mostly just don't bother with it

"you just can't figure that stuff out, yeah, etc."--they have an easier time accepting that you just can't really figure that stuff out i guess

like they give up immediately and don't bother and just go about life

not like "oh god woe is me" but like "aw well shucks you just can't figure some stuff out about life whatevs i have to go to the store or whatever"

that's good

nobody mentioned possibly leave your self-discretion 

and turn me all around

not to have to tell me what's around underground

turn me all around

gets me down so mind my manners

my own mind soon puts me under

think I care to think that I'm

concerned about some backstreet wonder

but then again far it's going to live past time

easily ignored when I'm aware

sheepily enjoying myself in time

a-weighing that everybody's there

take me home I shouldn't mind

I wouldn't in your sorry situation

and to put me in the backseat

Hey y'all, I'd like to contribute too (Parkside kids yay)! I was diagnosed with ADHD several months ago and it was one of the most revelatory and helpful events of my life. Since going on medication and learning about ways to structure my life as an adult to work with the disorder, I've become astronomically more functional.

I wasn't diagnosed in childhood precisely because I didn't exhibit the stereotypical signs of ADHD in children, like disobedience or an unwillingness to do schoolwork. As a child I was aware of the deficits in my functioning but I developed coping mechanisms that concealed them pretty effectively from other people. I never really considered that they might be due to ADHD, probably because the stigma surrounding the disorder scared me--I had the idea that people with ADHD were super-rowdy, uncooperative, and prone to outbursts of violence, and I didn't want to tag myself with any of those descriptors. It wasn't until I talked to a close friend of mine from college who had a very similar experience with the disorder to mine and who also was diagnosed as an adult for similar reasons that I realized I should see a psychiatrist.

There's a lot of misunderstanding about what ADHD really is as a disorder, definitely in the general population but I think even amongst therapists. The hallmark of the disorder is being unable to direct your behavior in certain situations no matter how badly you want to, which might not have anything to do with "acting out". In a way, I think the term "Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder" is misleading--the disorder is more about a deficit in self-direction, where your conscious mind makes frustrated demands at and desperate pleas with the rest of yourself which complies reluctantly if you're lucky and not at all otherwise. There have been countless times I've intended not to buy something and bought it anyway even if I'd be broke afterwards, wanted to leave the house to make it to something on time and sat there staring forlornly at the door as I became abysmally late, and even holed myself up in alone an empty room in an effort to work on something day after day for weeks and gotten almost nothing done (by the time I graduated from college that was my go-to approach for big projects).

It's also worth noting that people with ADHD can often concentrate intensely on certain tasks, usually those they find viscerally satisfying, for 

It can be hard to diagnose something like that in children, who are generally impulsive and don't distinguish as strongly between their actions and their desires. However, I don't think that means we shouldn't try. If I had been diagnosed and given treatment in childhood, I think my entire adolescence would've been infinitely easier.

Instead, I think we need to change the paradigm around how we diagnose. I do think there's a problem with parents in the U.S. being eager to pathologize and medicate their children for exhibiting behavior that's either normal or a sign of ongoing distress for environmental reasons. Ironically, in contrast to the article, the most unruly, disobedient kids I've encountered in my life had overly strict parents who would punish their children frequently; when their parents weren't around they'd act monstrous in an effort to let out all the frustration and pent-up impulse that their parents weren't giving them an outlet for. There are certainly some kids who act that way in response to ADHD, but the kids I've known (and adults I know now) with ADHD have more or less universally exhibited symptoms in more complicated ways. I think kids who are extremely fidgety, sidetrack themselves from work regularly even when they sit down intending to do it,

Analysis:

This narrative verse is technically distinguished by a wide range between completely speaking and completely singing, rapid variations in rhythmic structure, and dense, complex rhyme patterns, all designed to accentuate the emotional qualities of the verse's story. The verse has three sections, one from "and then" to "relax," one from "I stood up" to "pound," and one from "of that" to "crazy."

The first line of the verse, "and then she started", is repeated twice and begun away from beat one (on the second beat instead), both of which serve to create an anticipatory effect. The repetition catches the listener's attention, piquing their curiosity about what it was the woman started to do (she has been mentioned briefly earlier in the song, contributing further to a sense of anticipation). Setting the verse away from beat one reduces its heaviness, creating a "hanging in the air" effect that is amplified by the sparse texture of the beat behind it and preparing the listener for the second "started".

The second "started" drops on beat one and delivers the image we were promised a bar earlier. This measure rhymes the first and fourth beats and the second and third; the rhyme on the fourth beat helps to further resolve the sense of anticipation created in the first bar by more throughly answering the first line, and the second and third beat rhyme creates a sense of momentum. We are being propelled through the intro into the verse's interior. This whole section is sung in a straightforward IV-V pattern that catches the ear but not aggressively, effective as an intro pattern.

The next line, "oh I rap, baby, how old are you", is spoken by Lamar in the context of the story. He delivers it spoken, deviating from the melodic pattern of the previous lines. In this context, speaking the line both paints a more vivid narrative image and downplays the presence of the lines, which primarily serve as linkage between the images that come before and after them. After this, the next lines are sung in the same pattern. Every first beat has a rhyming word, and each rhyming word has its rhyming syllable on the downbeat with the exception of the last, "babies." The offset rhyme in that line is both an interesting variation and helps to resolve the pattern it concludes. Finally, the combination of singing and dense rhyming amplifies the presence of these lines, which are important as they introduce the verse's central concept.

The next two lines are spoken again and have the same effect as the lines spoken before them; speaking contributes to a sense of conversation and downplays them as they once again perform a linking function. The "I'm a' tell you later" lines are sung and densely rhymed again, amplifying the line, in which the woman explicitly comes on to Lamar. The image is intense and the emphasis put on it helps to set it up as the anticipatory material for the next section, in which it is developed.

This concludes the first section. Narratively, we get the verse's central image for the first time and move from conversation to explicit come-on. There is a large-scale pattern between spoken and lightly rhymed transitionary material and sung and densely rhymed important images, and a large-scale rhyming structure that is used in variation three times, in which a rhyme is set up, a different rhyme is set up within it, and then the lines are closed with material that answers the first rhyme.

The second section opens with transitionary material from "I stood up" to "yep". This material is transitionary both in the narrative (Lamar moves from the living room to the woman's room and they prepare to have sex) and musically, having a fairly simple structure that resembles and thus anticipates the more complex one following it. We get a vocal harmony for the first time, although minimally--the high voice drones on I while the low voice alternates between V and I. There are rhymes on 2 and 4.

The following material, from "Hope that I" to "nothin' we can do now" is introspective in narrative content, the first and only instance of this appropriate as this is the high point of emotional intensity for Lamar within the narrative. The focus moves to Lamar's feeling of excitement and the music helps the listener empathize--the material is sung in the verse's most involved melodic pattern and the rhyme scheme is very intricate, with rhymes in every beat including a repeating three-rhyme pattern at the beginning of each line. These devices maximize the energy level of the material and the beat behind it moves to compensate.

After this, the line "somebody walked in with a pound" serves to rapidly connect the second and third sections. It's sung in a melodic pattern connected to the material preceding it, but unharmonized, and hitting the VII as a way to move briefly off from I without as drastic a transition as III or IV. Its rhyme "pound" connects it to the preceding two lines but in a less heavy pattern as it lacks a rhyme for mood/do. Narratively, this is the moment where the energy is sucked out of the room as the sexual tension is defused by someone else's entrance. The dialing down of devices used in the previous material lowers the musical energy level to reflect the narrative event, and again the beat moves to compensate.

This opens section three, from "of that Bay Area kush" to "get it understood". Lamar returns to a speaking pattern, although his pitch emphasis on the violet-colored rhymes gives his delivery a sprechstimme quality that makes it more melodic that the previous spoken material. The rhyme pattern follows the now-familiar technique of setting up a rhyme, moving to a different interior rhyme, and then answering the rhyme that was initially set-up. The rhymes all fall on downbeats. This material presents a dramatic shift downwards in energy level from the previous material, and narratively serves to set up the central image of the verse.

The last lines are delivered in two voices speaking at octaves. As the line is a quotation, speaking helps to evoke the narrative image while doubling raises the intensity of the lines. The lines also contain the most involved single rhyme pattern of the verse, with eight rhyming syllables in rapid succession. These techniques give the lines a vivid cerebral intensity that distinguishes them from the more emotionally intense quality of previous emphasized lines. By eschewing the more emotional technique of singing and keeping the rhyme scheme focused on a single intricate rhyme pattern instead of carrying the listener forward in a more visceral manner by using a stream of varied rhyme patterns, the listener's attention is drawn aggressively to the content of the text which stands out powerfully. After the last word, there is a loud snare hit and then beat drops out for a second, amplifying the dramatic effect of the line.

a lack of resolve amplifies sadness a thousandfold

"Over the past two years, I have become continually more interested in phenomenology, and have acquired the skill set and knowledge necessary to begin doing real work in it. In order to mature as a phenomenologist, I now need to pursue a more independent project that will give me a sense of what would be required of me as a professional. I started working with a professor in the field at the beginning of the summer, who will oversee the project I have proposed, helping me to understand its relevance to the phenomenological community at large. This will push me in the direction of being able to formulate pertinent questions to explore once I have completed my graduate education."

It is notable that in some sense you are always alone in dreams. Although you may dream of others, like everything else in a dream you trust they are the product of your own self upon waking to a much greater degree than is possible in waking life. You can feel the other consciousness behind somebody's surface in waking life with visceral, irrefutable intensity, and the vivid flush of this feeling is absent in dreams. I believe it is this fact more than any other that has led people like William Burroughs(?) to point to dreams as more real than life, or even the only real life we have. But at the same time I would dispute this view--to say so does not do justice to the unanticipatable floridity of waking life, where reality certainly is if it is anywhere. Like all attitudes of its type it presents a cult of individuality, lost in a thirst for for-sure-ness--but you cannot know yourself for sure either, and the same mystery of life that lends it "unreality" is there in dreams too if you permit yourself to notice.

Getting in the habit of doing art implies a demanding religious practice, one that is hard to follow. Art asks you to let go of yourself, without fear or concern or preening. Even if you spend a lot of time on a single piece, it must be an automatic, reflexive process, not the result of anxiety. Similarly, you should not cut a piece short because it bothers you. It can be disturbing and unflattering to see yourself reflected back at you. To really get something out of doing art you have to work through that. You are not worth more or less than anybody else.

As an artist it is easy to get caught up in ideas about artistic quality. These ideas can really hamper your practice. You may carry around a giant rubric in your head that you use to evaluate every art piece you see, including your own, giving each one a score. You are likely to find that other pieces score higher than your own if you do this.

It's easy to justify giving up artistic practice, or not taking it seriously, if you have this experience. You say, "If there are other works of art like mine but better, what's the use of mine? My works can't accomplish anything that hasn't already been done, and better than I ever could."

You are not competent to say something like this. In fact, it misses the entire point. When you sit down to work, you are engaging in a process between yourself and the whole cosmos. Other people's artworks and your feelings about them are just one tiny facet of the cosmos. You're looking at it cross-eyed if you put them front-and-center.

To make art, take the present moment and let it fall out of yourself naturally. Don't push or tug it out. You have to disappear for this to happen. In /A Room of One's Own/, Virginia Woolf wrote, "...the mind of an artist, in order to achieve the prodigious effort of freeing whole and entire the work that is in him, must be incandescent, like Shakespeare's mind...There must be no obstacle in it, no foreign matter unconsumed. For though we say that we know nothing about Shakespeare's state of mind, even as we say that, we are saying something about Shakespeare's state of mind. The reason perhaps why we know so little of Shakespeare...is that his grudges and spites and antipathies are hidden from us. We are not held up by some 'revelation' which reminds us of the writer. All desire to protest, to preach, to proclaim an injury, to pay off a score, to make the world the witness of some hardship or grievance was fired out of him and consumed. Therefore his poetry flows from him free and unimpeded." This says a lot as long as you don't worry too much about who Shakespeare was.

So, when you make art, don't worry. Just let go. Despite the truth in that quote, you shouldn't worry about whether or not your art is preachy or made in protest or whether or not that's good or bad. Beautiful art can have any quality and much of it preaches and protests. It just does so on its own, with its own life, away from the artist. You can't make art like this if you worry about failing and make the art too much about you or not honest or good enough. If you have those worries as you make your art, and you don't put them aside, they'll come true.

Your own artistic preferences are just a curiousity, like a two-headed frog. If you like a piece, or someone else likes a piece of yours, it's just like a mirror falling off the wall or a day that was hotter than predicted. When you sit down to make art, you can't let there be any more meaning in it than that.

 Billy MacGee ran in from the left and did a back handspring onto the stage. He was dressed in black leather studded with shining rhinestones and his hair was so greased it didn't move. He turned around and began to walk towards the center of the stage but right away dropped into the splits and threw up a peace sign. The crowd cheered. He walked to the center of the stage and faced the audience in a wide grin, pretending to shoot at them with his hands. Then he burst into flame and burned wildly, disintegrating into ashes in seconds.

 The actual Billy walked on somberly in dress clothes. The audience went wild. He sat down at the panel table and stared frowning at the audience. When they saw this they went crazier.

 "It's a shame this guy couldn'tve been a vaudeville performer," said Joe.

 "I dunno, though," I said. "He might've just been like run-of-the-mill in that context. He seems like someone who could only really properly exist now."

 "Yeah, who knows," said Joe.

  There is a boy I have seen at a few parties whom I wish to befriend. In fact, I wish to befriend him very badly and have for a while now. But I have not had consistent success, and despite a few moments of intimacy I can't really say that we are anything but acquaintences, perhaps less. 

  I am not even sure my reasons for wanting to befriend him are valid. It's possible that what I have seen of him is something of a facade. I'm sure that what I know of his nature has truth /about/ it, at least--I don't think it's possible that what I know of him is completely a mask over the face of his true personality. But it could easily be true that his inner nature does not line up with his outer nature in any way that could be easily and confidently understood from his outer nature alone. 

  I think of a person's clothes. They certainly say something about the personality of the person, given they selected their clothes from a grand multitude of available clothes of different sorts, but exactly what is hard to say without coming to know them extremely well. The understanding of them that you form after becoming deeply familiar with them is vastly more specific and intricate than your impressions of them at first sight, such that those impressions seem like examining just the molding of what is ultimately a tremendous castle of great height and astonishing breadth.

  I first met him about three months ago. He appeared at a fairly small party I came along to with a few of my friends. We were all sitting in a circle around the living room coffee table. Four people were discussing where they had grown up--one was from rural Alberta, in Canada, another was from Grand Rapids, Michigan, and the last two were participating but had not yet gotten to say where they were from. Another group was talking about their favorite folk and then metal bands. To my right were a few people discussing craft beer.

  I was sitting on the floor and not involved in any of these conversations. I only knew the content of all of them simultaneously because I was browsing the room to see where I might want to jump in. As I was doing this, I happened to look towards the kitchen and saw a boy that I didn't know playng with the magnetic poetry on the fridge.

  He had straight brown hair about halfway down his ears and a well-maintained five-o-clock shadow, and he was wearing a light grey sweater over a black dress shirt and tight powder blue pants. His shoes were red. I wasn't quite sure what to make of him from his appearance, except to say that it gave the impression that he had thought hard about every aspect of it but in order to achieve a purposefully vague effect, one with dim, understated notes of dressiness and playfulness and maybe a subtle note of menace. It did not position him obviously in any particular cultural area.

  I saw him stand up from the fridge and leave out the kitchen door, presumably to smoke a cigarette. Out of curiousity I stood up and walked into the kitchen to read his fridge poetry. He had made two poems. This was one of them:

she has died

a blue fish

in red water

And this was the other:

and so

he put out

like a good dog

I was deeply intrigued and wanted to talk to him. I stood in front of the fridge for a while, hoping that he would come back in and see me reading his fridge poetry so that he would feel compelled to say something to me. But he didn't, and eventually I went back to the living room. He never came back inside, so I left without seeing him again.

A summary of current American events:

George Zimmerman is acquitted of murder charges after stalking and fatally shooting unarmed black high school student Trayvon Martin. His defense rested on Florida's 2005 "Stand Your Ground" law, crafted by the state's gun lobby. Although the law has in general doubled the number of homicides ruled justifiable since its passage, It has offered an overwhelmingly unhelpful defense to black folks in comparison to other racial groups. In cases where a black defendant shot a white person, there has barely been any increase in acquittals.

Unfortunately, there's nothing particularly aberrational about the Zimmerman case. More than twenty-five states in the Union now have stand-your-ground laws, and white folks have been getting away with murdering people of color for as long as the concept of the white race has existed. Just in the past few decades,& 

If that's not enough racism-in-action for you, 129 schools have been closed by the city of Chicago in the midst of budget cuts. 117 of them were majority black&

To add insult to literal physical injury, students who formerly attended schools with names like Marcus Garvey, Benjamin Banneker, and Mahalia Jackson will now attend schools named after wealthy white socialites who did nothing much aside from spending their cash. We get it, Chicago! White + wealthy = good person--it's a simple equation, nothing more to it than that. Somebody alert the Nobel Peace Prize Committee! I think the Koch brothers are due one.

In Texas, conservative state legislators rammed through a draconian bill of abortion restrictions that is likely to close nearly all of the abortion clinics in the state. The bill was unable to pass the bill during the legislature's regular session because it lacked the required consent of two-thirds of the legislators to be brought to the floor for a vote. In response, the governor called two special sessions, intended to be used to vote on emergency legislation that would have immediately catastrophic consequences if it could not be passed, to bring the bill to a vote, and suspended the two-thirds rule in the second session so the bill only needed a simple majority to be brought to the floor after it was filibustered in the first session. During the special sessions the Capitol building was flooded with furious protestors who were barred from speaking, thrown from the House and Senate chambers, and even beaten by State Troopers during a peaceful sit-in. Infamously, tampons were prohibited from being brought into the Senate Gallery during the second special session under supposed fears that they could be used as "projectiles," although concealed firearms were still allowed.

Bradley Manning's defense has rested its case in his ongoing trial, arguing that Manning was a high-performing intelligence analyst with strong ideals who wanted to help the world by revealing injustices committed by the U.S. military and governments around the world. The prosecution has argued that he should be convicted of aiding the enemy, under which he would be sentenced to life in prison without parole, because terrorists could use the internet to look at WikiLeaks and they might enjoy that or something. Prosecutors never demonstrated any direct harm stemming from his actions or even made an argument that such harm exists anywhere, just that it could theoretically. (As a side note, they also proved hilariously unknowledgeable about computers, arguing that he should be convicted of computer crimes because he used the "unauthorized program" wget to download documents he was authorized to download. wget and its cousin curl are the two most common utilities for downloading stuff at the command line and are distributed with most *nix operating systems; if you have a Mac, you probably have curl on your computer right now. They use the same protocols as web browsers; it's like saying he should be convicted of computer crimes for downloading his work email on the job.) If convicted of aiding the enemy, a precedent would be established allowing the government to bring the same charge against any journalists who publish information they've classified, ever.

Manning, through /WikiLeaks/, showed the world the "Collateral Murder" video in which soldiers in two helicopters opened fire on unhostile and mostly unarmed people in Iraq, killing two Reuters war correspondents, one of whom they fired on after he was on the ground wounded, and killing the father of two children who were injured in the attack as they stopped in a van to take the wounded correspondent to a hospital, among others. Manning was originally arrested for revealing this alone. With the help of /WikiLeaks/, /The New York Times/, /The Guardian,/ and /Der Spiegel/, he also brought to light the Afghanistan and Iraq war logs, revealing thousands of unreported civilian deaths at the hands of the soldiers of the U.S. and allies, systematic unwillingness by U.S. authorities to investigate allegations of torture, rape, and murder by Iraqi police and soldiers, and continuous examples of torture of detainees even well after Abu Ghraib, several of whom were tortured to death. Finally, he revealed the contents of thousands of diplomatic cables, showing the U.S. spying on top U.N. officials and diplomats, national governments colluding illegally with multinational corporations for mutual gain, and widespread corruption and nepotism under the authoritarian royal family in Tunisia, inspiring the revolution there that then sparked the Arab Spring. In light of all this, Manning was recently nominated for a Nobel peace prize by Mairead Corrigan-Maquire, founder of the Northern Ireland Peace Movement, who won the prize in 1976.

Before his trial, he was held in solitary confinement for ten months in a six-by-twelve-ft. cell with no window, watched 24 hours a day by guards without even bedding he could use to conceal himself, prevented from sleeping outside of a fixed period, and eventually forced to sleep naked under watch. The U.N. formally accused the U.S. government of treating Manning cruelly and inhumanly after conducting an investigation, although sadly they could not force the government to stop. To this date, Manning is the only one who has been legally accused of wrongdoing in the wake of the information he revealed.

Edward Snowden, still stranded in the Moscow airport, has requested temporary asylum in Russia until he can claim permanent asylum in Venezuela, Bolivia, or Nicaragua, all of which have made offers. The U.S., desperate to prosecute him under the Espionage Act, has revoked his passport and put immense pressure on other countries not to assist him, threatening Latin American countries with economic penalties like the ending of trade preferences and saying that helping him "would put relations in a very bad place for a long time to come." That pressure also led to the grounding of Bolivian president Edward Morales's plane in Austria while flying from the Moscow airport after France, Spain, Italy, and Portugal refused to allow it to pass through their airspace under suspicions that Snowden was onboard. Morales was furious, saying to European countries, "We are no longer in the colonial period." Other South American nations were similarly outraged, seeing the grounding as a snubbing of South American sovereignty by Western powers. The Union of South American Nations, of which Bolivia is a member, held a summit last Thursday in anger over the grounding.

Snowden, with the help of journalist Glenn Greenwald, documentarian Laura Poitras, and the newspaper /The Guardian/, among others, revealed that the NSA has been intercepting and collecting email, phone conversation metadata, social network activity, video and voice chat, and more, without warrants, from over a billion people in dozens of countries, including the U.S., with the help of allied foreign intelligence services and prominent tech corporations. He acquired the documents proving this while employed as an NSA-contracted systems analyst. He's said that he identifies as a patriot and has nothing against the U.S. government, but rather believes these sorts of programs are dangerous to a democracy and wants the public to be able to decide whether or not they're desirable.

James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, lied under oath to Congress in March when he denied that the NSA collects any data on millions of Americans. The Director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, did as well. They are both guilty of perjury, and there have been calls by some members of Congress as well as many journalists for at least their resignation if not prosecution. Notably, Salon columnist David Sirota pointed out that if the Justice Department is willing to prosecute baseball pitcher Roger Clemens for perjuring Congress, they must prosecute Clapper and Alexander as well, or they will fail to uphold equal protection. Despite this, Snowden is the only one to be charged with anything relating to his revelations of indiscriminate spying by the NSA.

I'd like to say that the bright side of all this is that it's so bad it can only get better, but I don't want to jinx anything. Maybe the government will build a database of everyone who's black and/or pro-choice, then have the military secretly capture and torture some of the black folks to death and then openly kill the rest in drone strikes while the cops go around beating all the pro-choice folks to a bloody pulp and confiscating all the tampons. When an official or two gets reluctantly prosecuted over it a month or two after the rest of the world has exploded in outrage, they'll argue that the government was just defending itself and get acquitted. Any nations that seek to distance themselves from the U.S. afterwards will be openly threatened by the State Department until they step in line. The NRA will publicly celebrate and then say the main lesson to be learned is that civilians need to be able to openly carry MANPADS and RPGs. I wish this stuff was ridiculous enough to be funny.

On a brighter note (or maybe a much darker one), far, far away from our strife-ridden Earth, at the center of the Milky Way, there is a radio source called Sagittarius A* (pronounced a-star) that is almost certainly the location of our galaxy's central supermassive black hole. There is a small gas cloud, about three times the size of Earth, rapidly approaching it in orbit as you read this, with estimates placing its closest approach sometime between now and a few months from now. It will get within 36 light hours of the black hole's event horizon and may be ripped apart completely by the tidal forces, which would probably lead to much of it being accreted. Metal!! Hopefully we'll learn some cool things about how black holes work and maybe get to watch some mesmerizing grainy astronomy videos.

 I imagine that my responses were coming in at wildly inappropriate times, like that he was saying "Oh man, did you hear that the other day--" and then I was laughing and giving a big thumbs-up like I was in a parody TV commercial.

I love minimal elegance, in which something is fully itself and no more or less than that. "Minimal" in the sense that it has the minimum it needs to be what it is, with no fluff. It's only complicated if it needs to be complicated, but it's only simple if it needs to be simple, too. Everything not made by people seems to be like this, and I like things that people have made best when they too seem to be like this. When I am making something I do my best to give it this quality.

I decided I wanted to learn to program when I was six, and after some false starts I learned Logo when I was nine and wrote games and fractal generators in it using Microworlds. I also made and programmed Lego Mindstorms robots, and learned HTML and some ActionScript and made a few websites. When I was a few years older, in middle school, I picked up BASIC and used it to write text adventures for my friends to play.

A few years after that, when I was sixteen, I went to college, where I took a comp sci course as a freshman and learned some Java. That summer I got hired by a startup and did ActionScript and CSS/HTML/JavaScript programming for them.

I moved more into doing IT support while I was in college, and when I graduated I found work in a data center as a NOC technician. I was considering a career as a network administrator and studied heavily in my free time. After a while, I felt that networking was really interesting conceptually, but the work itself was very dry and I wanted a similarly technical but more creative job.

A little over a year ago, a friend of mine with an art gallery asked me if I would submit a piece to a show of hers and I wrote something in JavaScript for it (www.machineandthegarden.com). I was reminded how much I loved to program, and started looking into doing it for a living. At first I was going to JavaScript meetups to test the waters of that community, and met someone at one of them who was organizing a Rails hackathon to make apps for the benefit of the general local community. That sounded cool to me and I was curious about Ruby, so I went, By the end of the day I'd fallen in love with Ruby and decided I want to understand it deeply.

I read O'Reilly's /The Ruby Programming Language/ cover-to-cover, playing around with the example code, did some Ruby Monk, and then branched out into studying code design (yay Sandi Metz!) and writing command line apps. I did Michael Hartl's Rails tutorial, worked through /The RSpec Book/, and started looking at the Rails internal code and poking around in gems. I developed a love of TDD. I wrote a Rails art gallery application for some visual artists I'm friends with (glittery.herokuapp.com), and a blog for myself with Sinatra (palelight.herokuapp.com). Right now I'm studying algorithm design, deepening my understanding of JavaScript and its ecosystem, and working on a couple of patches to submit to gems I've used. I know enough Ruby now to get a sense of just how much more the veterans know than me at this moment, which is an exciting place to be.

Programming has the perfect mix of technical and subjective. I love fields of endeavor like this, where you are drawn to develop a deep, subjective relationship with a complex matrix of relatively objective knowledge. The knowledge itself is static and needs you, with your subjective understanding, to animate it. When that happens, things get created. I compose a lot of music (I majored in music theory) and it feels almost identical to programming. I think of those areas as part of a larger toolset, even--when I want to make something for myself, I ask myself whether it would be better served by being an application, a piece of music, or a piece of literature. Sometimes it's two or all three (there's a lot to be gotten out of interactive literature--I think we've just scratched the surface). A lot of the applications I write for myself are interactive art pieces, and it's wonderful to me that programming is the way to produce them, because it's so pleasurable as an activity.

At the same time, programming is uniquely lovable to me as a craft. I don't really have a craft-type of relationship with music or creative writing--I love them, too, but only if I'm solving very specific sorts of problems. With programming the crafting process itself is a joy regardless of what I'm working on. 

10/31/11, 8:00 AM

Zachary and I woke up at around 1:30. He was asleep when I woke up. I showered and shaved, and when I came back, he was awake. Lauren and her friend Amy came in, followed closely by Elliot. Elliot was making Amy's and asked Zach if he had some hot sauce he could put in it. Zach had Torchy's and Garven Store Grande Salsa. We discussed how the jar of Garven Store salsa was probably the only jar in all of Vermont, or even New England, which lead Zachary to decide that we should go get some chips at Hannaford's to eat that salsa with. We decided to go on the spur of the moment, but then Lauren and Amy disappeared, and Elliot went off to tend to his Amy's, so our departure was interrupted. 

Zachary called Rosie to ask her if she wanted to come. She decided that she did, and came over. I decided to make some tea, and started the process right as she arrived, so I made tea for the three of us. Elliot seemed to have wandered off and we didn't know where he was. He came back as I was pouring the tea and decided to make more tea from the once-brewed tea leaves, so he took off again almost right away. Rosie, Zach, and I sat together and drank our tea. Rosie and I took whisky in ours. Elliot came back and had his tea, and two folks whom I didn't know came in for a few minutes. One of them, a tall, blond-haired, REI-style fellow, commented on how I was pouring the whisky precisely, because I was using an 1/8th cup measure, in a cheeky way. Elliot left again soon after they did to tend to his Amy's.

Elliot came back as we were getting ready to leave. We asked him if he was ready to take off and he said he could take his pot of just-finished Amy's in the car. He sat in the back, amongst the drums from last night's 34 show, while Rosie and I shared the passenger seat up front. Elliot decided to stay in the car while we shopped. We took a while in the grocery store, each of us wandering around individually and intersecting every once in a while. Zachary discovered that cans of Chef Boyardee food were a dollar a pop, so we both bought a few. I also bought some rice and lentils and a big container of oats. While I checked out, I accidentally spilled some lentils on the self-checkout counter, and wanted to clean them up, but there were two folks in line behind me who seemed eager to go and I didn't want to slow them down. Rats.

I asked Zachary if he had paid me back for the Dave Koz tickets and he said that he hadn't. We had a slightly awkward conversation about it in which he said that the felt sort of like I should have reminded him about it and I said that I thought we were sharing the responsibility of doing that equally since we both knew where and when the show was. Eventually we both just decided that it was a sad but useful lesson to learn and that we should be more careful to go to shows we buy tickets to in the future, obviously. I felt really icky about bringing it up, as I usually do about reminding people to pay me back for things, but if he was going to do it at any time, now would be phenomenal, since I am so close to broke (I don't want to get my friends to give me money when I need it because that's my responsibility, but that's money that he owes me and would be paying me back for, but I still feel weird about it--uggghhh, it's just badness). He said he would after he got his next chunk of transcription work payment.

After we got back, Zachary decided to hunker down and do transcription for the rest of the day since he'd been putting it off throughout the weekend. Rosie and I began to talk rather heavily--she was wearing a shirt that said "Dixie Rose / Southern by the Grace of God" which I asked about wryly ("Do you consider yourself a Dixie Rose? Do you feel Southern by the Grace of God?") and turned out to have belonged to her great-grandfather from Ohio, which spurred on a heavy conversation about family dynamics. We talked about how he had recently died, and how that was sad for her as she barely knew him and wished she had known him better, and then began discussing the ways in which her family fit together: how her mom's parents were divorced and their sides of the family didn't get along, how her mom and dad had met, how her mom's parents had gotten pregnant on accident when her grandmother was 15 and her grandfather was 17 and split up a few years later after a rough marriage, how her great-grandmother collects teapots, has written the names of the people who will inherit the teapots when she dies on the bottoms of all of them (some of them will go to Rosie!), and once sent Rosie a gift late because she put Rosie's address in a teapot for safe keeping and then forgot which teapot she had left the address in, and such. Around this time, Zachary told us that our conversation was really distracting, and asked that we either start doing solitary, non-conversational activities in the room or go somewhere else. Rosie said that she wanted to make muffins, and invited me to come to Noyes with her to do that and keep talking.

Rosie and I had one of the greatest conversations I've had with anyone. We talked about:

Her grandparents and great-grandparents some more--like how her great-grandfather was a State Trooper (she showed me a picture--we spent a while looking at a scrapbook of hers) and was named Dixie Spencer, how it was strange going to visit one side of her mom's family and then the other because they resented each other and spoke about the other in very disparaging terms dispute not actually having very many attributes that would cause real friction between them if they talked to one another, how her mom's parents go to show how you can never be sure whether or not you're going to have a baby--she said that they only had sex once and her grandmother hated it, but happened to get pregnant just by chance from that--and how she was bothered by Zachary saying that he would only have a kid if he was "financially stable" because she felt like he could never be sure of that

Class and how growing up poor allows you to pick up life skills that growing up rich does not (although I s'pose it goes the other way too--at one point I mentioned how rich folks seem to pass down knowledge about things like investing and finance that allow their children to also become rich and how that knowledge often seems not to make it far outside of rich folk land)

Autism--her experiences with her brother[], the importance of autistic people and how they can show us unique and important aspects of the human experience[], the difficulty for them to be accepted[]

Arabic culture--language[], poetry[], music[]

Learning language--Arabic[] and Japanese[]

Music--the free, open way that Zachary and I learned music vs. the structured, self-esteem-wrecking way that Rosie did and how that has influenced the ways that we experience music as an entity and interact with it[], the closeness of music and math[], counterpoint, Bach, Glen Gould, and Hindemith[]

Distillation and the distillation book I have[]

Her friends from home, her relatives, things she had found on the ground, and people she had dated that featured in her scrapbook[]

Dating people--her: Joss[], Caleb[] me: Lauren--abusive relationships[], the dynamic of both feeling capable and being willing to put your own needs aside for the sake of others[], the strangeness of being very-heavily qualified bi[], the special difficulties inherent for us in sex/emotional contact (I cannot believe that we have these things in common what on earth)[]

The World Outside: My experiences with "energy"[], talking to plants, animals, and concepts, the feeling of your boundaries being very in-flux and not something to be taken for granted, and being far away from the "tangible" world and close to a different one in early puberty (again, what on earth)[]

School: being smart and isolated in first grade[]

Parents: lack of veneration[], developing independence early[], having a hard time identifying with other kids' perceptions of their parents[]

Eugene: anarchists v. cops/squares vs. hep folks, dwarves and lesbians, gay culture (her sister, etc.)

Her acid trip/Her and Zachary dynamics

11/6/11, 6:30 AM

I'm coming down from an acid trip, and I'm in a place where I feel like I'm making connections between things well. I'm sitting in the Common Room in Franklin. It's rosy-dawned--the sky is almost the exact color of a slightly overripe peach at the horizon and a pale indigo at the sky's epicenter--and a thin layer of white frost pets the top of the grass outside.

The current dynamics between myself/Rosie/Zachary/Zachary/Rosie/etc. are heavy and complicated. It seems sort of like we are in a place in which we can have incredible experiences one-on-one with one another, and a pretty good time when together, but the intensity of the goodness we experience when interacting with each other in pairs is so heavy that when we are all together, we inevitably begin to pull apart. The dynamics seem to be:

Zachary and Rosie - Are a couple and have very coupley interactions--they like to curl up with each other and talk to each other sweetly and kiss one another and slightly introduce what's going on for each of them otherwise every once in a while. There's a heavier dynamic, too, which seems to be perhaps what keeps them together: Rosie is someone who likes to take care of, and Zachary is a very intense, outward, non-self-conscious person who is very take-care-of-able as a result --- Zachary is someone who likes people who are very specific and unusual and cute(sy), and Rosie has an extremely unique place carved out for herself and is [small//thinks of herself as small, thinks well of that, and thus occupies that] and cute(/sort of cutesy). She seems to enjoy holding him when he wants that and listening to him talk and watching his antics, and she's glad to see when he's cleaned up after and when the people around him are in tune with or at least unimpacted by his antics (she likes him too much to necessarily do those things herself, it seems like, although she may also just be like straight-up unworried about them--it's hard to say if she's glad for them as a reflection of the desires of the other people around or directly from within herself). He gets really into how small and cute he sees her [/as/] being, and how specific and otherworldly she is. You can sort of tell that they've been together for a year--she sometimes gets frustrated with his lack of self-awareness and unwillingness to indulge her wants when they heavily conflict with his directly, and he sometimes gets conflicted by having strong internal desires that aren't hers, sensing what she wants, and not wanting to indulge her quite enough to go with her. They also don't really seek each other out with great heaviness--neither one seems to badly want the other, necessarily, when they're not around each other--if Rosie feels distraught, her impulse is to be distraught alone although she appreciates company (does she pine for him when he's not there but not tell him? if so, is he even aware? I wonder! how sad?!), and Zachary gets very involved in what's going on around him and doesn't feel a strong pull in himself towards her, to the point where I have ended up facilitating couple moments between them by suggesting that we go and visit her. (I wonder if they get so heavily coupleish around their other friends--almost certainly not--though maybe--, although that could be because both feel or at least Zachary feels comfortable enough around me to do that. Even that says something, though--when the three of us are in the room, often their dynamic pulls them together//they feel comfortable as a couple/dynamic with letting that happen even though I am there. I sort of wonder if Zachary, by a series of elaborate steps as opposed to directly, initiates that as a subconscious way of pulling tight to Rosie and not having Rosie and I snap together, although Rosie may also initiate those interactions--if she does (I just haven't been looking at them closely while they get into this state, outta, like, politeness) I imagine it is more out of a desire to receive Zachary''s latent heavy affections more heavily than anything else that's going on than any particular desire to pull tight to him and far away from others. Rosie does not seem to have any interest in keeping Zachary from me at all--in fact she happily lets us spend hours together while she's alone or doing other things--and when the three of us are together she'll gladly interact heavily with me, sometimes even until Zachary becomes really uncomfortable and makes that verbally explicit (not in a like, "Stop it, you're making me uncomfortable" way, but just almost--like that moment last night when he said that Rosie and I were talking about things he couldn't access and it made him feel insecure, which pulled Rosie to him.)()))))))&

Someone's getting into Cardiacs! They're getting like three albums from me.

okay

Zachary and I -- are old and extremely close friends and it shows. We get very involved not only in our own collaborative antics but also in sharing the parts of the world that we access together with each other, particularly because we know few other people who access those parts, and none in quite the way we do. We have heavy differences--he's extroverted and I'm introverted and he's active and I'm passive, and we have different ways of seeing beauty--his much more through action and mine more through perception, it seems like. But it some ways, those differences compliment each other; he feels he can be really up front with me in ways he doesn't feel he can be with other people, and I'm really glad to hear what he says in those veins. I also feel I can be really/pretty up-front with him (it depends--and I'm sure there are things he doesn't say to me, obviously) and sometimes he's interested in me in that way, but often our dynamic tends towards him projecting through me (in a projector sense, not a psych sense)--he almost uses me as a tool to process stuff, since he has a hard time holding everything in his head consciously and I can lay it out for him and draw connections after he's talked through what's going on for him for a while (like just recently tonight, in a way that contains heavy aspects that really deserve their own entry at least, but just briefly to touch on this dynamic--he pointed out that I get joy from giving as something that interested him, and I explained the intricacies of that--not only how I specifically get joy from helping people fulfill desires they have and making sure they're comfortable, but also how I am happy at being part of "the patterns," in our speech (I might individually say the unfolding, or the core essence).and how I feel tension between those two modes, because the utter fulfillment of one folds the other into it as a sub-aspect (having a child vs. being an artist, with being in a close relationship and an artist as the closest possible total merging of the two). He was into that, and asked me to repeat parts of it several times as he lost focus so he could really hold it all together, and make a strong effort to really get where I was coming from, but the weight of the conversation really fell when he was talking about what having a child would mean to him in contrast to some of the stuff he had heard me say about it that he didn't quite grok, and ended up saying that he felt like him and his kid would seem to him to be "biological" equals, in that by having a kid he would really feel that he had sort of put himself into the world apart from him, and then ended up saying that he could die and feel okay knowing that his kid was still in the world (not that he would want to die since he'd want to provide for his kid and keep living his life and all, but it would be okay). I pointed out to him what an extremely heavy thing he had just said, in that he had basically stated that once he had a kid he could die happy and there was nothing else really in the world that would keep him from feeling that way, and said that it sounded like he really really should have a kid. Heavy! When he started thinking about that, he began to cry and cry, and cry. I wanted to hold him, but the best I could do was offer him a hug--I knew he was not only thinking about the gravity of what he had said but also his own father, and we hugged tightly and very close and for a long time. Eventually he decided that he really needed to be alone to feel what was going on for him fully, so I went out into the Franklin common room (and here I am(!/too soonish)) [Later he came out and said that he had talked with Rosie and was going to go on a walk with her, which made me feel glad since I felt that if she was still awake she probably felt sort of neglected, especially with the whole her room for her/Zachary's room for him spiral in Zachary that had earlier separated them].

Zachary and I love to break stuff down together, both by talking and through antics, and really love how well we can do that with each other, but in a lot of ways I really feel like that story just captures the whole essence of our friendship--us breaking stuff down together is something that trans-lates/positions into heavier things for us. If you are traveling into our essence, it's what you see a lot of just before you get to core stuff.

(to grok vs. to comprehend: to comprehend something is just to understand it, but to grok something is to understand it and be down with it. some folks really always grok and rarely or never comprehend at a distance.)

okay

okay

so

Rosie and I -- have the hardest-to-describe relationship out of the three of us by far.

(Oh my goodness! Zachary and Rosie just came back and they brought me flowers that were frozen but thawed when they came indoors--they were sad because they had brought them to be covered in ice--oh my goodness! How sweet! How specifically sweet!)

10:41 AM

Okay, so, predictably, that led far away from this and heavily into several intense conversations with Zachary and Rosie that have brought parts of this more strongly into focus, recontextualized parts of it, and all that--Rosie fell asleep in Zachary's bed maybe two hours ago and Zachary hit a thick wall of tiredness in our ensuing heavy conversation that is pulling him into sleep as I write. I'm also exhausted, and given the time it's probably pretty phenomenal that I'm going to bed, in the long run. I'll keep going over this, with the new parts!, when it's time.!

11/25/11, 12:25 PM

Just awoke. I had a number of dreams last night; they may all have been part of one large dream, since I'm not entirely sure where each one ends and the other begins, and they involve some of the same characters and settings, but right now I'm intuitively separating them into three different dreams. 

In one dream, I had a vagina, though everything else about my body was the same as in waking life. In the dream, I had been born that way, and felt glad about it, because it seemed to match the ambiguous manner in which I related to gender. At one point, I had to explain to a gal that I was about to sleep with (had recently started a relationship with? I think so), while we were in bed together, that I was intersexed and it would be something we'd have to think about like logistically with sex. She was intrigued, and asked a lot of questions (what my genetics were like---I said I was probably some sort of chromosomal mosaic--though of course in waking life that wouldn't really work--whether I was sterile--I said almost certainly--how I felt about it--well--and so on), and luckily wasn't perturbed at all.

In the next dream, which may actually have been a part of the third, I only remember one moment: I was in some sort of college snack bar with dim lighting and plastic blue furniture, and someone (may well have been Rosie--almost positive it was--will act like I'm totally positive it was from this point on) told me that they had overheard someone else whom we both knew say that they had never seen someone who so much was "a girl trying so hard to be a boy." I told Rosie that it was sort of sweet of them to say that because I felt like although I didn't necessarily agree exactly it indicated that they were "paying attention." We had a conversation about how I was frustrated that much of my gendered actions seemed lost on the people around me and it was nice that someone was picking up on them at least a titch.

The third dream was very me-Zach-Rosie-oriented. As I recall, I was living in a kind of backwater Kentucky-or-something town with Zachary and Rosie and the dream focused very heavily on Bennington, which I was trying to attend more or less for pleasure despite having already gotten a degree. Much of the dream centered around the logistics of me doing that--where I would live, how I would pay for it/convince the school to pay for it, why I wanted to despite having already graduated from a different college, etc., and what Zachary and Rosie and I would do while we were there together. I wanted to go to be with Zach and Rosie and because I thought it might be nice to experience being in college again at the point in my life I'm at now, since it might remind me of some things about that experience that I'd sort of forgotten or shoved under the rug or whatnot. We spent a lot of time driving around town in a van we sort of collectively owned, visiting friends we had. Towards the end of the dream, I think Zach and Rosie were leaving to go to Bennington or had already left, and I was trying to figure out how to get there--it seems like via this guy we all knew, who was a sort of cheeky Chinese guy, who had offered to drive me there. Actually, yeah, now that I'm thinking about it, I think I woke up while we were driving through this huge, sort of gleaming golden/ruby city that had a giant suspension bridge, that I think my traveling companion said was San Francisco (why we were driving through San Francisco on a Kentucky --> Vermont trip is, like, lost on me, of course). I'm not sure I ever really figured out a total solution for how I was going to go to Bennington, but I had decided just to wing what I hadn't yet pinned down when I got there.

A'ight, I'm gwan make some tea an' what.

dreamt parents ended up getting back together

dad feeling unattached to relationship with Caroline, Damon nonexistent

in end decided to move back into apartment they had been living in originally (in the dream they had been living in the same city the whole time, the one the dream took place in--looked rather like a cross between Austin and Adams-Morgan, actually)--dad explained it was because their parents had been paying their rent on it before and they wanted to do it themselves, which for whatever reason was a completely understandable explanation to me in the dream

mentioned it was smaller than the apartment dad was living in now and he pointed out that it'll be easier to clean because there'll be less wall space to get dirty

earlier in dream by sheer chance I had been in that exact apartment on some sort of adventure with Zachary, Rosie, and Taylor

they decided to get back together after my dad went over to my mom's apartment, for some reason

Possessions can be a difficult thing to get rid off--they'll sit there all quiet for a month or two biding their time as you steel up your nerve and then they'll plant a few seeds--

"You know," says my father, "that eight-track has a really good pre-amp."

But I have a computer, I think to myself. I have been planning on ditching the eight-track for the computer alone for two months to get ready to go somewhere else where these problems will not exist. A paucity of materials creates inn o vation and all that. Things are expensive and I can do without. And all that.

"Yeah," I say, "it sounds much better than that M-Audio box."

When push comes to shove, will I make the honest decision? A nefarious way of working. Mind control.

1/24/12, 2:21 AM

OHMIGOD ART HISTORY, WHY HAVE I NEVER STUDIED THIS FIELD BEFORE

There is a historical trajectory that starts with cave paintings and continues up through, say, Katie Pipkin! Why did I never really think about that in those terms before?

Visual art is /so complex/! I am feeling a bit of field remorse almost--should I have been a visual artist? Well, no, music is complex too in being sort of more "essential"--it deals with extremely fundamental structures that gives it greater complexity in other areas. I am interested in the mitigation of personal experience through fundamental strata and the relationship therein. Visual art seems focused almost exclusively on portraying relatively personal internal experience fairly directly, albeit in symbolic terms--it is perhaps the art form that comes closest to capturing the experience of being physically alive. Literature sort of captures the experience of being emotionally alive, while music captures the experience of being intellectually alive. Of course, all of these areas talk to each other and each art form deals often closely with all three--but it seems like at the very end/beginning of each of those modes that fundamental aspect of experience is present lensing everything else.

Of course that would intuitively lead me to believe that I should be doing lit primarily--which is a question for me right now for sure. But I find music fascinating too--if my consciousness was only slightly differently-flavored I think I might not write without music at all, and I think this really shows in my writing, even. I will probably continue to revolve around and around in this thought loop for at least a few more years if not decades even.

3/12/12, 6:33 AM

Naturally I am driven to diary by tripping, and naturally I feel that I would like to be diarying more often.

WOOOOOOF. This was a difficult trip in some ways. That's okay, but that is how it was. At its peak the combination stimulus of Rioux ( + Rioux v. Keija ) and Zachary being aggressive and ambiently combative made my external social environment pretty heavily inhospitable and I felt very overwhelmed and hurt even. I wish Zachary was nicer to me. Goddammit but like that's just how it is. I know he means well and is just acting on impulse but his impulses have actual meaning and content which I don't think he really acknowledges much. In a way I feel touched, like in a first-grader-being-picked-on-by-another-kid-who-has-a-crush-on-them way. But like we should be able to interact better than that.

 It's interesting to me how there is actually like serious elementary school style social dynamics at play in all this, like /seriously/, at least with Z+me+Rosie+//Rioux maybe even sort of?like as the mawkish socially awkward kid who is kept out of heart-to-hearts. If I utilize the right frameworks I can get myself to feel almost like I'm seven. It seems sort of out-of-control to me. I'm not sure if it's just because I'm particularly sensitive to those sorts of signals right now or if it's because close group adult social interactions without any larger institution structure just generally have strong parallels to that or if it's because there is some sort of heavy dysfunctionality at play. It may well be all three.

There is so much stuff I really just want to get off of my chest that, given the social field I have, I want to talk primarily to Rosie about. But I am not sure she is really the ideal person actually--she seems so verdantly introverted right now that I'm not sure she would really be into receiving a signal that strong from someone, and I'm also afraid of Zachary butting in (and I don't want to hurt his feelings or have Rosie feel uncomfortable as a result of that dynamic --(which would also have the icky sideffect of making it yet more uncomfortable for us to interact in general) ).

3/12/12, 8:27 AM

I am in a just wonderful mood now! I went outside and watched everyone and waved to a few people and then took some field recordings. It's nice to know that I can take field recordings if I want a "role" to play that I can enjoy in public space that's not purely ambient or interactive. I love having field recordings, and the novelty of seeing someone outside taking field-recording-type actions seems like a good signal to present to the ambient social environment to attract the sorts of people I might like to talk to.

In any case being throughly by myself is as always helping me feel healthy.

3/12/12, 8:45 AM

I have to start keeping a dream journal again!

It's so strange, to be who I am now, and to consider everything that has happened up to this point

3/16/12, 2:44 PM

Just /woke up/ woke up. Zachary and I decided to go into business together with ScribeSavvy last night, he managing the transcription aspects of the business and I managing the technical and administrative aspects, mainly. We are envisioning the roles as fairly fluid and will probably share work as it comes. I'd be very pleased if this became work I could support myself on, I think.

It's interesting--my dreams still display some videogame influence even after all these years.

3/16/12, 9:27 PM

A pipe helps to rouse me, helps me to feel clean, to feel calm and alert.

what on Earth was /wrong/ with me pre-2009? ugh

6/13/12, 12:22 PM

dreamt about gabi

I was reading some essays and felt as if I should be writing some of my own thoughts down, instead of taking mostly passive actions. Obviously on some level thinking intentionally or analytically about a piece of writing is in itself 'active' but less so than writing. At the same time I had to stop reading an essay I was in the middle of to do this (I need to start getting ready to leave the house soon so I'm presed for time) and felt pangs of guilt about stopping in the middle of it since it seemed important. No escape! Either I feel guilty about not writing my own thoughts out or I feel guilty about not reading something important.

Right now I feel like I'm in a perpetual struggle with everything in my life. I feel embarassed writing this down because it has a vibe of overblown melodrama, and I feel afraid of what soemone might think of me if they read it. Nevertheless I do feel that way! Rggghhhhhh...

It's hard to keep track of what I "really want". Am I trying to become a successful computer programmer? A successful artist? Both, and if so, which first, or how can they be integrated? Are my answers to these questions at any moment the "right" answers, as in will they actually get me what I want? What /is/ it I actually want, and do I want the things I want for the right reasons?

I'm continually frustrated by the feeling that I don't fit in even in the spaces where it seems like I would most belong. I feel a weird mix of strong identification and bemusement at the words of all the people I admire. Sometimes they'll say something that seems //so true// and I'm thrilled to read or hear it. Other times they'll say something that seems sort of suspect to me, or just confusing, and inevitably I wonder if I'm right in finding it suspect or confusing. Maybe I don't understand my own immorality, or I lack the background or acuity to process what they're expressing.

Inevitably I'm afraid that if I express myself I'll offend and confuse people. I want to be perfectly understood and upset no one, ideally. At the same time I have a lot of opinions that other people detest. For this reason I probably can't avoid upsetting some people if I express my opinions. In some ways I'm not that worried about thisÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂif someone comes along who holds opinion /I/ find detestable and disagrees with me, that just seems inevitable. What I'm really worried about is having people I respect find fault with my picture of the world and reject me. In some cases there are no second chances with these peopleÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂthere are so many people out there abusing them that they don't have time or energy to invest in anyone that gives off the impression of being out to hurt them. That makes sense to me; it seems pragmatic.

It's so hard to tell if my thoughts are "correct". I dont't have much confidence in my own analyses. I always feel like I need more experience and more time before I should show anything of myself to the world at large.

There is, of course, a catch-22 in this. The best way to get the kind of experience that allows to you to interact with the world in the way that I want is to start doing it. Inevitably you will make some people angry and upset and you have to deal with this. I think the issue that I have is that I don't want to have to do this. Learning that I failed to reach someone or brought them anger or sadness when I said something is like having a huge chasm open up under me. I feel I have failed at everything I try to be in life: kind, sharply analytic, and articulate.

I'm bi, or omni, more accurately, in that I have the capacity for attraction to (and have been in relationships with) people who are trans and/or whose gender identity doesn't fit into the traditional binary. My sense of attraction is essentially gender-agnostic. I'm attracted to men more often than women; I'm probably like a Kinsey 4.

It might seem curious that most of my relationships in my life so far have been with women, given this. I've actually dated men twice, but I've mostly kept those relationships private. Beyond that, I went to a very small college; male students whom I could date long-term I could generally count on two hands. In a pool that small it's hard to find a mate. I did have an overwhelming crush on a boy there as a freshman complete with elaborate romantic dreams and lots and lots of pining. To my disadvantage, I didn't fully realize this until the summer, and when I returned to school in the fall I found that he had changed as a person in ways that cooled my interest in him. I've only been in a relationship once since graduating; along similar lines, the social groups I've run in since then have consisted mostly of straight people.

I've also been reluctant to pursue guys for the simple fact that if I started a long-term relationship I would then feel obliged to openly explain my sexuality which I've been very reluctant to do. Clearly I'm no longer prohibitively reluctant to do this and saying so is partially a way for me to open up that possibility for the future.

I also have a byzantine sense of gender, with swooping icy crevasses, rolling golden plains, glittering oceans, and lots of stars and comets and cherry blossoms everywhere all the time. I don't really know what else to say about it in a format like this. Any of you are welcome to ask me questions in person but please be respectful, not that any of you wouldn't. It's the most personal topic I have to talk about, out of anything, for sure.

I wanted to tell y'all all this for a number of reasons. I think it's important for queer people to be out if they can and I've just been too afraid in the past. More specifically, though, I'm coming back to Austin and some of the feelings of alienation I've had here in the past are because I haven't been open about my queerness. As far as I know y'all are mostly straight and there have been times I've felt sort of out of place in social gatherings. I haven't been able to speak up for myself in the past without outing myself.

I also want to note that I'm an ardent feminist, of the patriarchy-is-everyone's-fault-and-everyone-suffers and gender-needs-complicating variety. I really like Judith Butler. This shit is hugely important to me and I'm down to talk about it whenevs if any of you ever wanna. Sometimes I've vaguely gotten the feeling in social settings I've been in with some of y'all that these sorts of attitudes are being rather frowned upon in the moment by some people or just like the possibility of anyone having them is being sort of ignored. Generally I haven't said anything, so that's like totally on me. All the same my feelings are white-hot.

Is it possible to get an accurate picture of me from my Facebook wall? I am not in a position to answer this question now and never will be.

I did read that report; I ended up just removing bluez and bluez-utils since I don't care that much about using those peripherals. I imagine that if I downgraded the kernel to 3.10 I might be able to run bluez and get the trackpad to work, but I think I'd rather use the most recent version of the kernel.

between this general theory of ordinary Frobenius liftings and the theory of

(which also define canonical coordinates). Relative to this analogy, the

N

on

may be regarded as corresponding to the

on complex Teichm

N

is,

in a very real sense, a

Moreover, there is, in fact, a canonical ordinary Frobenius lifting on the ordinary locus

of the tautological curve over

whose relative canonical coordinate is analogous to the

canonical coordinate arising from the K

*there are grave problems with how we do gender

 this is not a new idea--I'd be surprised if no one here has heard anything of the like

 however every time this idea has cropped up it has been rather different, since it's formed out of gender relations at the moment it comes into existence

 at the present moment I think we have a fairly new set of circumstances that have been barely recognized

 we have solved or made great progress towards solving problems that used to be central

 economic equality is far from being achieved but enjoys a popular acceptance that is greater than ever

 domestic relations are greatly modified--our generation feels less of an attachment to marriage and reproduction than any before it I think, to the point that both heterosexuality and monogamy are widely critiqued

 these problems are not over but they are widely understood as problems--the issue is convincing those yet to be convinced and coming up with practical solutions

 however this has exposed new problems that were invisible yesterday and continue to hold everyone in chains

 it's said more and more today that feminism is for everybody , that it stands to benefit men as much as women and so on however I think when this has pointed out it thus far has generally been underexplored--the case has rarely been made in full

 we can see two broadly different perspectives in feminism alive today

 they date from two different parts of the movement

 there's the second-wave perspective, which was dominant in the 70s and especially the 80s

 this perspective holds that the gender binary is totally real and concrete--in other words, that it's obviously possible to divide people evenly into men and women

 it then goes on to discuss in detail what it means to be a woman, or a man, generally with regard to furthering the position of women in society

 this perspective works hard to really define what womanhood is, so it then can be advocated for, endorsed, and so on, and the ways in which men are hostile to women and what can be done about it

 there's also the third-wave perspective, which first emerged as a wide-scale pattern in the 90s

 (both of these perspectives have in some way been around for much longer, it's worth noting--this is like when they became prominent)

 this perspective holds that the gender binary is a fictional construct of a sort--one invented and propped up by culture that doesn't necessarily need to be there and quite possibly shouldn't

 it emerged as a response to second-wave feminism--there were a lot of women who felt that the picture of womanhood constructed by the feminists that came before them failed to include or advocate for them

 many feminists of the second wave were white, upper-middle class, Western academics whose status as women had never been widely challenged

 lots of feminists of the third wave were of color, poor, from the third world, outside of academia, or in some other way outside of the picture of femininity that had been made by their predecessors

 this project of broadening the definition of womanhood to include previously excluded populations quickly led to the conclusion that anyone might potentially be a woman, or a man, and also that perhaps those constructions had less descriptive power in general than we used to think

 although one emerged in full as a response to the other, both are very alive today in their own ways

 they sow discord in feminist conversation--it's easy to find bitter debates on Jezebel comment threads, feminist blogs, your Facebook wall, etc. that come from people taking the foundations of one or the other perspective for granted

 I think that in order to even really see, let alone address, the new vitally important problems that our ways of doing gender present to us today, we have to understand why those perspectives coexist, and, ultimately, find a way to unify them

 there are shades of truth and important problems with both, I think

 they might seem totally irreconcilable, but I think if we tread carefully and deftly we can find the space they have in common, and we'll discover new and important things there

*I think a good place to start is with a brief thought experiment

 imagine that you ask someone what gender is, and they give a common response--they say, "male or female--gender is whether or not you're a man or a woman"

 obviously there are other responses to this question, but I'm sure we're all familiar with this one

 this invites the question of what "male" or "female" means, and if you go on to ask this such a person is likely to say, rather sheepishly perhaps, that a man has a penis, and a woman has a vagina

 however this response might still strike you as rather strange

 for example, you could pose the following situation to this person: you could be like, "say you have a male friend who's in an accident and loses his genitalia--would you still treat him as a man afterwards?"

 probably they'll say yes--if they don't for some reason, you could remind them that unless they've actually seen the genitalia of all of their male friends, they have no way of knowing that this isn't already the case for any of them, or even knowing if any of them were born with a penis or testicles, and they treat them as male anyway

 at this point, they might change their approach a bit and instead talk about genetics--perhaps they'll say that women have two x chromosomes and men have an x or a y

 there are all sorts of intersex conditions that present a challenge to this perspective

 for example, there are people who are born with x and y chromosomes but are physically insensitive to androgens

 there are varying degrees of this, from slight to total insensitivity and a whole range of different bodies and identities can emerge

 in those who are mostly or more-or-less totally insensitive to androgens, they develop as phenotypically female, because the human body generally converts androgens that aren't taken up by cells into estrogens

 they usually have a heterosexual female identity

 there are a whole range of challenges to this method of situating gender in physiology--Simone de Beauvoir dedicates a whole section to it called "Biology" in The Second Sex, people throughout the intersex and trans communities have done so, and so on, if you're interested in more

 let's suppose at this point that the person in question now moves to situation their definitions elsewhere, even more abstract--they say, "well, okay, fine, but you can't deny that men and women are different--they move differently, they talk differently, they care about different things, and so on"

 at this point, they have moved from defining gender in physiology to defining it in personality--in this definition, gender has to do with how you express yourself

 and if you go on to ask them what differences they mean specifically, they are liable to give you a rundown of the characteristics we commonly associate with masculinity and femininity

*these characteristics have been discussed and analyzed throughout the ages, and they've changed a lot over time--in the present moment in which we live, I don't really think we need that sort of scholarship to know what they are--we already do

 we think of masculinity as being about power, functionality and utility, physical strength, bigness, confidence, outspokenness, brashness, independence, dominance in conflict, and so on

 we think of femininity as being about beauty, passivity, submissiveness, cooperation, smallness, empathy, soft-spokenness, personal sensitivity, aversion to conflict, and so on

 if we look a bit deeper, we can see that they both posit a certain way of handling challenges

 masculinity seems to propose a strategy in which you address challenges by directly opposing them--when something pushes against you, you push back with greater force so the challenge is dispelled, you make yourself so intimidating that it seems impractical to challenge you to begin with, you grow so much larger than the challenge that it ricochets off you harmlessly, and so on

 femininity seems to propose a strategy in which you address challenges by defusing them--you make yourself too charming to be desirable to challenge, you subvert the challenge by stepping outside of it and striking from some place the challenging force could not see, you empathize and compromise with the challenging force and thus negate it by uniting with it, and so on

 if we really think about it, it's plain to see that any

Once, when the world was still shut away in darkness, the Goddess of Mana powerfully felled the Divine Beasts, 8 incarnations of calamity that were leading the world into ruin, with the Sword of Mana, and sealed them away in eight immovable restraining stones. Thus, the darkness passed, and the world was created.

The Goddess of Mana turned herself into a tree and fell asleep, and long months and years went by......

However, the Divine Beasts were released from the stones again, obtaining power surpassing even that of the gods, and conflict broke out through scheming people who thought that they would take over the world, spelling the end of peace...

 

From beneath the earth mana was rapidly lost, and the Tree of Mana began to die...

Reese, Queen of Rolante, the Kingdom of the Wind, was Rolante's protector, and on this day, as leader of the Amazoness Army, she left to go survey the mountain...

"All right, let's give this a shot! Everybody watch!"

"Reese, my Lady! Be careful!"

"Yay, I did it! ...That said, there's gotten to be a lot more monsters now than there were before...

"And, the wind...the wind is...the wind is crying..."

The Mountains of Rolante

Here, they used the surrounding cliffs as a natural fortress; it was famous as an impregnable castle, the Castle of Rolante...

Furthermore, the elites of the Amazoness Army held the defenses, and for an eternity it had appeared that it would be impossible for it to fall to a foreign invasion. However...

 

"Well, it's time to practice martial arts... I have to find my little brother Elliot...

"Reese m'lady, there's nothing out of the ordinary!"

"This Rolante castle uses the the surrounding cliffs and the cliffs' powerful crosswinds for protection, and it's world-famous as an impregnable fortress!"

"In this room, we worship the Goddess of Mana."

"Waaa, Prince Elliot took my lunch money!"

"It's said that the peak of Rolante Mountain dwells in the top of the sky, and that the Father of the Winged Things is a messenger for the Goddess of Mana..."

"You and the Goddess of Mana are similar, y'know..."

HP?MP

"If you pray at the statues of the Goddess of Mana that are all over the world, a record of your game will be saved. And there's also a golden Goddess of Mana statue in the basement of the castle that will replenish your HP and MP too."

"Master Elliot? He isn't coming this way but... 

"You're looking for Master Elliot, m'lady? Does his grandmother Alma not know where he is perhaps? Speaking of her, she's in Master Elliot's room to the right of the king's chambers..."

"When I grow up, I'm going to be an Amazoness warrior as beautiful as you, Miss Reese!"

"Oh, Princess, I heard you've been taking an active role in patrolling the mountain these days!

 

"You're taking over from the last, late princess, you can generally serve as the leader of the Amazoness Army--this old man is happy...ooooh..."

"The base of Rolante Mountain is in the fishing harbor town of Paro."

"Here are Princess Reese's and Prince Elliot's rooms."

"Aah, please excuse me, I'm cleaning m'lady Reese's room, I haven't finished yet..."

"I've been here for a long time, but I haven't seen Master Elliot come this way."

"You're looking for Master Elliot, m'lday? Would his grandmother Alma not know where he was perhaps? Speaking of her, she's in Master Elliot's room to the right of the king's chambers..."

"Father, do you have any knowledge about Elliot?"

 

"Mine eyes have not seen him, but I do expect we will recognize a sign... Keep waiting...Hmm...It does not seem that he has gone far. I dare say...It appears that he is somewhere within the castle, but..."

"Really, y'know, I, like, wonder where he could've gotten off to! And in spite of the fact that it's time for martial arts practice..." 

"Well? We haven't seen Master Elliot either, so"

"Soo, Alma! Haven't you seen Elliot?"

"Oh, just as far as I'm concerned, I've been thinking that you and Prince Elliot are in the same place. I'm assuming he hasn't gotten away from your environs..."

"Since the Most Honorable Queen died shortly after Master Elliot was born, as far as that child is concerned you're something like his mother, you know..."

...

The Queen of Rolante bore a little brother, Prince Elliot, for Reese. The mother Queen gave birth to Elliot, looked at his face, and died without fuss...

In the eyes of the very young Reese, it was a peaceful sleep, and her mother's face was given new life in the face of her little brother...

okay! so, I suggest you cup the pieces of jackfruit husk in your hands outside

um, really, make chakka pradhaman, a delicious South Indian pudding! here's a recipe you can work from: http://www.kothiyavunu.com/2011/11/chakka-pradhaman-jackfruit-payasam.html#.UZqfQuu6VQa

you want about 3 1/2 cups of chopped jackfruit flesh. if you end up with less, adjust the rest of the quantities accordingly.

you can get a 500 gram package of Kolhapuri jaggery at Man Pasand Grocery (3601 W William Canon Dr #750) and then just add all of it to the pudding. it's a nice ride down South 1st and then left on William Canon (I've biked it before, it's pretty). you could also probably get jaggery at the Fiesta near the SCUM universe if you're up that way.

use a fresh coconut to get the coconut milk! you need one anyway so you can put tasty fresh coconut pieces in the pudding. here are more detailed instructions for extracting the milk: http://coconuts.casaveneracion.com/how-to-extract-coconut-milk-cream/ don't forget to save a tablespoon of the flesh beforehand to chop and add to the pudding at the end. note that whenever you need coconut milk for anything you can always do it this way instead of buying canned if you want extra-awesome coconut flavor!

use fresh-ground cumin and cardamom! as in, buy whole spices and grind them by hand (you could get them at Man Pasand or Fiesta as well)--the flavor (particularly of the cardamom) will be completely different and /way/ better. if you don't have a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, you can use a coffee grinder. clean it first so you don't get coffee in the pudding--but I wouldn't bother cleaning it afterwards 'cause then your coffee will taste like cumin and cardamom for a little while! you can also make a makeshift mortar and pestle using a sturdy ceramic bowl or teacup (not a mug, it's gotta have sloped sides) and the bottom of the handle of a hammer. split the cardamom pods open and just grind the seeds inside--the pods themselves won't powder. don't use fresh ginger though--it has a different flavor from ground ginger. if you want to make ground ginger, completely dry out thin slices of ginger on a sheet pan in the oven at 150? and then grind (but if you use store bought ginger powder it'll be okay--the cardamom is the biggest deal). roast the spices in a dry frying pan on medium heat, stirring constantly, until they smell very intense (just a few minutes) before adding them to the pudding. 

lastly, you don't need a pressure cooker to soften the jackfruit if you don't have one--just cook it with the water on medium-high heat in a thick-walled pot with a lid until soft and mashable (a dutch oven would be ideal if you have one but just use a heavy pot otherwise). keep an eye/nose on it and stir it now and again so it doesn't burn. it should take around 20-25 minutes.

hurrah, best of luck! I wish I was there to eat it!

Awful! Awful! Awful! What an awful thing to say! Still, no matter what awful things you say, I'm definitely going to look after it. It's /my/ baby, you know! You have no reason to scold me--I swear to God I'll stab you!"

A number of people have mentioned the association between radioactivity in general and nuclear weapons specifically. I think that's part of the dynamic, but definitely not the whole picture. I have a morbid fascination with (ionizing) radiation--I regularly read the Los Alamos National Laboratory's /Review of Criticality Accidents/ like a favorite novel, watch documentary after documentary about Chernobyl, stay up into the night reading technical descriptions of reactor meltdowns, and so on. For me, atomic bombs aren't at the heart of it--they seem far more threatening for their conventional explosive power. When I think of the sick, fascinating fear that radioactivity can inspire, I think of Chernobyl first and foremost, then perhaps the death of Louis Slotin or Cecil Kelley.

The release of radioactive material as a disaster certainly isnt unique in being a large-scale danger, but I think its special place in the mind of the general public isnt entirely irrational. There are some things that genuinely set it apart. Its partially distinguished by its immediacyit can happen in the blink of an eye, as opposed to something like global warming that takes place over a larger timescale. The degree of harm it can produce is determined heavily by human action, which contrasts it with natural disasters that we struggle to control or even helpfully predict, and that degree of human agency can fuel a sense of mistrust and suspicion of conspiracy on the part of those working to prevent or contain radiation accidents. This puts it in a similar category as pandemics, which are closer to natural disasters but are far more influenced by human intervention and control in a way that fuels paranoia, and especially chemical and other industrial accidents, which are generally similar. However, it is unique both in the potential longevity of the damage it can produce (neither pandemics nor chemical accidents have rendered swaths of land uninhabitable for centuries) and in the frequency of its occurrence, which I think has particularly sensitized the public.

We havent had an acutely virulent pandemic in the Western world since the Spanish flu, and the world hasnt seen another chemical disaster on the scale of Bhopal. On the contrary, we have seen, in the last seventy years, Chernobyl, Fukushima, Mayak, SL-1, Windscale, Three Mile Island, accidents and contamination from nuclear tests like what happened to the /Daigo Fukaryuu Maru/, a host of criticality accidents, and so on. Chemical accidents havent occurred with comparable levels of frequency or intensity. With pandemics, its easier to say that our improved knowledge of disease protects us from another 1918 because it was a relatively long time ago, and although were definitely concerned about the idea of something like a world outbreak of a weaponized virus, such events remain science fiction. On the contrary, Chernobyl happened less than thirty years ago, and Fukushima is ongoing, so we cant say with any confidence that we know enough now to prevent such disasters from happening, or keep them from spiraling out of control once they start.

Furthermore, radiation exposure has its notoriously wide spectrum of possible effects. It shares its insidious invisibility with pathogenic microorganisms, definitely, but disease caused by infection normally has a fairly specific constellation of symptoms, a known course with a few important complications, and so on. Radiation exposure can produce anything from nothing identifiable, to a slight increase in long-term cancer risk, to a marked increase, to acute illness and a high chance of developing cancer within a few years or less, to inevitably fatal acute illness that runs a rapid course. The specific symptoms can also vary widely depending on the material in question and how the dose was absorbed. Radioactive particulates spread readily in air and water over long distances, too, and some take a very long time to decay. All of these factors combined make it dangerously easy to develop a feeling that a nuclear disaster halfway around the world could be poisoning your food, air, and water without you being able to tell, in a mysterious way that produces no immediately identifiable effects but will ultimately kill you in the years to come. This is all true of exposure to certain chemicals too, of course, but again I think fears of such occurrences on a disastrous scale are comparatively lower just because theyve happened less often.

Subtle, cancer-causing pathogens like HPVs are, I think, less generally frightening both because they dont also cause acute, short-term deadly illness or environmental poisoning and because there isnt much of a question about their presence. Since we know that HPVs are nothing new and common throughout the world, its easier to come to the conclusion that theyre not worth worrying about very much because life as we know it clearly goes on anyway and has for millennia in their company, even though deaths from cervical cancer alone in one year outstrip the number of deaths from all radiation accidents in history. Accidental, widespread radiation exposure is an aberrant occurrence that wasnt an issue pre-WWII, so its much easier to feel that its hard to say how much of a threat radiation exposure really poses and that it might be far more dire than is usually claimed.

The secrecy with which many governments and companies have handled nuclear accidents doesnt help either. From Mayak to Chernobyl to Castle Bravo to Fukushima, there is a trend of cover-ups and efforts to mislead the public, cooperating organizations, and those employed to clean up the disaster, such that we often only understand the true scale of what has happened years later. This makes it easy to worry that there may be nuclear accidents happening in secret, maybe nearby to you, even if theres nothing in particular to suggest it. It also makes it easy to worry that any nuclear accident that does occur is far worse than youre being told.

Greater education would certainly helpfor instance, I wish more people understood that radiation exposure can be reliably measured and is only known to cause pathology beyond certain thresholds, which could ameliorate the increase in abortions, depression, alcoholism, and suicide that is sometimes observed in populations that have been negligibly exposed to radiation from an accident. A better track record of straight talk and sober competence from organizations charged with cleaning up radiation accidents would probably do even more. Its hard to educate people about radiation when theres such widespread distrust of public officials and scientists around the topic, especially considering that such distrust stems in part from real past and present lies and cover-ups. I have particular sympathy for radiation conspiracy theorists and paranoiacstheir fears may be irrational in their intensity, but its hard to blame them.

I loved reading your description of Euler's identity! Although I've heard of it before in passing (from one of my friends who is a physicist--the same friend that showed me the murmuration video--who compared it to Maxwell's equations, which he feels similarly about), I had never examined it closely. It's very remarkable! I loved seeing the animated model on the Wikipedia page--it's very easy to see what makes it so incredible, even for a layperson: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ExpIPi.gif . I can't believe that something so graceful could come out of such a small, straightforward set of elements.

Someday I hope to have expert knowledge of mathematics! It seems so beautiful.

One of my favorite things, on a rather analogous note, is a piece of music called /Spem in alium/, also known as /The Forty-Part Motet/. It was composed by Thomas Tallis around 1570, in England, for eight choirs of five voices each (thus forty parts in total). Here is the Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spem_in_alium , here is a copy of the score: http://conquest.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/a/af/IMSLP30201-PMLP66937-Tallis_Spem_in_alium_full_score_PML.pdf , and finally here is a recording: http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Thomas+Tallis+Spem+In+Alium/4QOeaO?src=5

The word "motet" can be a number of things--it always refers to a type of choral music, but what the characteristics of that type are changes depending on what historical era you're talking about. During the Renaissance, which is when this piece was composed, it usually referred to a polyphonic choral composition, often in imitative counterpoint, using a religious text in Latin. /Spem in alium/ is all of these things.

Polyphonic (poly- 'many' + phonic 'sound') music is music that has more than one distinct, independent melody, as opposed to monophonic (mono- 'one') music which has only one melody with no accompaniment, and homophonic (homo- 'same') music which has one dominant melody accompanied by chords, like most pop music.

Counterpoint is a technique of musical composition. When writing contrapuntally (the adverb form of counterpoint--the adjective form is "contrapuntal"), you have a number of distinct, independent voices, or melodies. You strive to keep them independent from one another, but also to make them communicate with another, in order to produce a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts. Imitative counterpoint is a type of counterpoint in which the voices enter at different times and repeat a version of the same melodic pattern, often going on to introduce further variations of that pattern in an elaborate musical conversation.

/Spem in alium/ has forty distinct voices that are set together in imitative counterpoint. As you listen to the piece, you can hear the voices passing musical ideas back and forth to one another and developing them over time. Each voice has a remarkable degree of independence, which allows the piece to change in texture radically many times as it moves forward. The piece's intense emotional power is generated through these contrasts as well as the incredible beauty of the melodic ideas--the sudden shifts from a quiet, distant statement of an unbelievably touching melody from far away to a whirling mass of brilliant voices.

This is the text of the composition (the lyrics, so to speak):

"I have never put my hope in any other but in You,

O God of Israel

who can show both anger

and graciousness,

and who absolves all the sins of suffering man

Lord God,

Creator of Heaven and Earth

Tension is usually talked about in music in the context of "tension and release." It's possible to look at music as essentially the art of creating and releasing tension with sound, and for much of Western music history this was the perspective composers took (many still do, of course, although there are other ways of looking at music).

However, "tension" alone is not a technical descriptor--it doesn't imply any particular method for creating itself. It's an emotional descriptor. In this sense, the short answer to the first part of your question is, "Tension in music exists when music feels tense."

That said, we /can/ use tension as a guiding idea in composition; we just need a way to define tension technically. We could do this in any number of ways, but for teaching music students in the West I think it makes sense to talk about common-practice-period-style tonality as a route to understanding tension in general.

Throughout the common practice period, "tension" was looked at structurally in terms of harmonic dissonance, and "release" was looked at structurally in terms of resolution of harmonic dissonance gracefully into harmonic consonance. There's more to it than that, though--for instance, a major triad sounds consonant on its own, but some major triads sound dissonant when played one after the other. This is why the concept of keys exists. Each piece had a single tone in the Western scale (like A, F#, etc.) that was used to orient it in relation to all of the other tones (this is where the term "tonal" comes from!). 

A rough hierarchy of harmonies from most to least consonant was recognized in the context of the key of the piece. In a piece in C major, the C-E-G major triad was the most consonant harmony possible, and other harmonies were understood as more consonant or dissonant in terms of how much they destabilized the sense of the C major triad as consonant. In other words, in a piece in C major, you can just play a C major chord and hang out there in ultimate consonance, but the moment you play some other chord you have moved some distance away from C major. You may have moved just a little bit away--like to G major, the dominant of C major, which sets up the ear for a return to C major and reinforces the sense that the key of the piece is C major--or really far away, like through a sequence of harmonies that establishes the sense that, say, the piece is now in the key of F# major.

It pains me to give nutrition advice that I'm sure will lead to poor health at best, but in this case I think it's really for a greater good. You should switch from eating hot /Triceratops/ guts to fernsnot because I think it will be better for your health, but rather because the world will be better off in the long run if you die of starvation.

Bear with me here. You /are/ pretty cool, I recognize. Your big gnashing teeth and thundering footsteps and all that are awe-inspiring for sure. You have to admit, though, that you're not that different from all the other /T. rex/. There's sort of a "seen 'em once, seen 'em all" thing going on with y'all. And you're getting in the way of some animal species coming on the scene that display some pretty incredible variety from individual to individual. It just doesn't really sit right with me.

Look at this way. I'm a big mammal. I'm familiar with a lot of other big mammals. We do some really remarkable things, but you're getting in the way of us ever even coming into the world to do them at all.

Consider humpback whales. They're mammals, but like all cetaceans, they live in the ocean! They evolved from land mammals so I think that's amazing. If that's not enough for you, they sing long, intricate songs to each other in a theme-and-variations sort of style. Maybe that's too abstract for you to get into. Think about this: a small group of them can, using synchronized hunting techniques, devour a whole huge school of fish in a couple of seconds. As a voracious predator, I'm sure you can appreciate that.

And, actually, while we're on the subject of predation, my own species has really made predatory activity into an art form, if I may say so myself. We're so apex-predator-y that we kill and eat other apex predators in droves. Did you know that we kill around 73 million sharks each year? They have tasty fins. Also we just kill them on accident a lot of the time while we're trying to kill and eat gajillions of other fish, even though we're totally adapted to life on land, because fish are delicious. Going the other direction, something like ten people get killed by sharks each year. We're playing a crazy game. And that isn't even getting into farming. 

We sing really beautiful songs, too, also. I know you're probably not that into music, again, but you must at least recognize that it's really interesting that we do both of those things. We do so many other things, too, like shoot golden records into space and make glass so strong that it doesn't break even if you run into it with a forklift. And there's so many other big mammals I haven't even gotten too, and they're all amazing. I'm naturally proud of my own species, but I wish you could see an elephant. The world's just such a colorful, out-of-control place with all the big mammals around.

So, I think you've had a good run, definitely, but you've gotta know when to step aside, too. You and your whole dinosaur cohort are occupying the ecological niches that us mammals need to move into in order to thrive. If you just stick around, all you'll have for mammals are those little shrews and things running around, and none of this awesomeness can ever happen.

We'll never forget you, I promise. Your brilliant contributions to crazy predatorhood will be remembered millions of years into the future. Grand monuments will be made from your bones and displayed in huge buildings for the joy and awe of countless people, and your image will inspire a plethora of films, statues, and posters. But only if you're willing to pass on the gauntlet to the next generation of animals. Otherwise, how will we get museums, or films, or statues, or posters, or anything like that? Or paleontology, for that matter. Your bones will just lay in the ground forever after you die.

Anyway, I didn't take a Hippocratic oath or anything, so although I still feel a twinge of guilt I might as well go whole-hog with this. I'm going to tell some /Triceratops/ to stop eating ferns and start eating each other. Good and efficient. That's human ingenuity at work, right there.

Hi Paul,

I wanted to follow up about the book I mentioned, Owen Barfield's /Saving the Appearances/, in case you're interested. If you like myth, I think it's a really wonderful read--he does a fascinating job of constructing a model for the ways that people living in mythic cultures tended to look at reality, and how the patterns in myth emerge from those perspectives. He also posits a neat model of how those modes of thought developed gradually into those common today. It adds a unique dimension to reading and thinking about myths, and helps to call attention to some basic assumptions we tend to make about the world today without noticing we're making them.

He was an Inkling (along with C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien), and as such he discusses his ideas in a Christian context near the end of the book. If that's your bag, that section is probably desirable, but if it's not, the ideas at the heart of the book are secular and you can really take or leave it. Similarly, the book is sometimes packaged contemporarily as being focused on Christian spirituality, which isn't really true and wasn't how the book was presented when it was first published. Barfield also promotes the work of Rudolf Steiner at a few points, who had some similar ideas but I think is rather nutty by comparison and not as wholly great a thinker as Barfield claims. Those points are parenthetical and passing them by doesn't hinder the book at all.

In any case, I think it's wonderful. Here's the Amazon page if you want to check it out more: http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Appearances-A-Study-Idolatry/dp/081956205X

Thanks so much for having me in for interviews and the happy hour afterwards! I really enjoyed conversing with you and everyone else I spoke with at Avant.

All the best,

Long ago it was proposed on several occasions that human beings are made from a substance such as dust, dirt, or clay. I do not think this is the best perspective. It has also been proposed that human beings are made from things like snails or sugar. I think this is getting closer but it's still not really there. People are made from a mixture of stars and flowers in all of their states of birth, life, and death.

Those of you who are used to doing cut-ups with scissors may feel that this method is wicked, because it uses a computer and computers are supposed to be cold and inhuman and unfit for art. I don't think there are many things further from the truth, and it seems to me that this assumption is always made purely in the gut with no examination afterwards. Computers are, I think, perhaps the most human machines in the world today, and best regarded not as unfeeling automatons but as like Phillip Pullman's daemons.

So, here are what appear to be some facts:

Life (or at least my life, right now, but also definitely every life forever always) has a number of hard-to-wrangle-at-best dynamics inherent in it that are interacting in a way that make me feel very bothered

No one around seems to really have a handle on these--just about everyone who isn't like a friend of mine doesn't seem interested or able to confront them at all in any way, and a few of my friends are aware of them but feel as perplexed about them as I do

Occasionally I will run into a really excellent writer/philosopher/etc. who will clear up a relatively abstract part of that equation, but knowing how to take that information and turn it into day-to-day action is just as challenging as any of the other problems

Ultimately it seems as if I have to deal with this stuff completely internally, since the external world doesn't seem to contain helpful resources

Here are the problems:

rails app:

set up ssl (heroku)

improve views

user strategies:

 pros:

 easily extendable to multi-user site

 established implementation strategies

 cons:

 more than necessary

 sort of awkward given single-user setup

 insecure--anyone can conceivably create the admin user (and possibly modify

 the account settings, depending on the sign up implementation)

automatic creation of admin user if none currently exists:

 pros:

 easy to implement

 easy to use

 cons:

 insecure--someone could theoretically jump on and grab the admin account

 depending on the implementation this may be possible even after 

 an admin account is created

default password:

 pros:

 slightly more secure that auto-creation

 still easy to use

 cons:

 still insecure--default password is exposed in documentation

seed password from an external doc written with a shell script:

 pros:

 secure--app is initialized with settings that only the person who installed it knows

 easy for admin user

 cons:

 have to spend time figuring out shell scripting

 have to spend time figuring out file i/o

Hi CrazyOsi! :wave:

It sounds like what you're really worried about is having hallucinations in waking life during SP, particularly disturbing ones. These "hallucinations" are really more like dreams or near-dreams and can be dealt with accordingly. Also, I think it's easier to escape SP into full wakefulness than that article describes. |)

The "hallucinations" you may experience during SP aren't like the kinds of hallucinations you might experience if you were psychotic. If you see unusual imagery during SP, you are almost asleep; what you're seeing is basically dream imagery. You have two options here: fully enter the dream so you can take actions or completely wake up.

Entering the dream from this state is easy and may even happen naturally. Treat what's happening as an LDÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂtake an interest in what's happening around you, try to change something, etc. You're likely to discover that you're fully in a dream (and now able to move and such) within seconds, and you can handle anything unpleasant that's happening in whatever manner you prefer during an LD.

If you want to wake up, trying to move your physical body is actually a good idea in my experience. Whenever I've ended up in SP and wanted to be fully awake, I've always tried as hard as I could to move one of my hands. Usually I'm able to move my arm within a few seconds, and the rest of my body almost immediately after. I've never had any trouble with unwelcome hallucinations or anything doing this.

SP is usually a welcome state for WILD practicioners because you're so close to dreaming when you're in it. If you're really interested in WILD and want to succeed, ending up in SP would be a fortunate thing for you, I promise. Keep your eyes closed, focus on your hypnagogia, and you'll probably find yourself in an LD quite rapidly.

I always feel so many ways at once about this stuff! I definitely share your sentiment that it's wonderful that people are talking about in a way that seems constructive.

It seems like part of the difficulty with that protocol comes from variance in what people take different types of affection to signify. A lot of expressions of physical affection have a sort of irrevocably romantic flavor to me that I know they don't as much to a lot of people I know, which leads to I feel like some sort of sad situations where someone I know will do something physically affectionate to me that I really like and appreciate and am touched by (har), but to reciprocate in kind often feels too scary and heavy to me even if I know they wouldn't feel that way about it. By this protocol, that would be okay--I could just say that explicitly--but it's hard to get away from the feeling that by saying that explicitly to someone I am pushing them away, which I /really/ don't want to do in that situation especially since I feel like they've extended themselves touchingly far in even being willing to be physically affectionate with me with us just being friends. On the same note, if someone does something affectionate to me that does make me viscerally uncomfortable but I know it's meant well and it's not something I'd call morally wrong to do without permission in general, I don't really want to tell that person not to do that because I know they were being nice to me. I know it can take a lot of courage to express affection and I don't want to denigrate an action towards me that was by all accounts really sweet, all the more so because it took guts. I think affection imbalances can really introduce discord into any sort of human interaction, even if both people say they're okay with it--like in this case it can start to feel sad and/or weird after a while if there's something that you like to both give and receive that you give to someone else who says they like receiving it from you but don't feel comfortable giving it to you. It starts to feel like either they're only letting you do that to them for their benefit and you're actually making them uncomfortable by doing it or they're generally less comfortable with you at all than they let on and they just don't want to say so.

It gets into the whole guess culture/ask culture thing--for me explicitness before implicit understanding defeats a sense of intimacy. I know that isn't true for everyone and when I've talked about this with asking-oriented people some of them have objected and been like, "No, not being explicit just wastes time and invites misunderstanding," and although I can't necessarily disagree across the board those people are definitely living in a different world from me. If we're all to set up a protocol for maximizing affection it seems like it ought to take this potential disconnect into account, and I'm not sure how--I don't really /want/ to tell other people what I want from them affectionwise because then I feel like I've set up an obligation or at least a system for them that is theirs to create--like I want someone else's expressions of affection for me to really be from them and not from me in a roundabout way. It can be hard to know the difference between "I want to be really nice to you but I haven't been sure what's best so thanks for telling me" and "Now I feel like I have to do x and y for you to consider my actions towards you really nice, even though I never would've done x and y of my own accord," or "Normally I would do this for someone I feel friendly towards but for you I'll find something else because now I know you don't like it," and "I guess you want to keep me at more of a distance than I thought."

As a side note, I feel just the same way as you about expressions of general social appreciation! I'm always really gratified when someone else tells me that they had fun with me or that they liked something I invited them to get involved with or whatnot and I'm trying to do my best in general to let other people know when I feel that way about things they've done with or for me. I know there are people who feel that even that sort of thing is uncomfortable, though, in that if someone thanks them for something nice they did they feel like a frame has been constructed where that person is in some way repaying them for it and they don't want the other person to feel that it had any strings attached and might even feel a bit put off that the other person would assume it did. I struggle with that stuff when it comes to some kinds of favors--I'll initiate a long "Oh, no, you don't need to do that" "Oh no but it's nothing" kind of exchange, which makes me feel a lot more comfortable but I know can frustrate someone who doesn't feel the need to do that. I don't really know what to do about that--I do feel icky accepting some favors without having an exchange like that first but I don't want to force someone who doesn't feel that way to do something irritating to them as a prerequisite for doing something nice for me. Part of me feels like those folks ought to sympathize with folk of my ilk and another part of me feels like I should try to get myself not to do it for their sakes.

Yeah, I think with sex it gets the most complicated, or a least it can! The implicitness thing comes into play most heavily in that case for me--I actually draw a really strong line between sexual and non-sexual relationships, sexual relationships are always romantic relationships for me and vice versa, I'm very monogamous, etc. etc., and establishing a romantic relationship for me is always an implicit process. Like, if someone tells me that they want to be in a relationship with me before they've made that implicitly clear to me and I've implicitly responded in kind, I won't hold it against them but unless I'm already sure I want to be with them I instantly won't feel interested in them that way even if I was considering it before. Building a sense of implicit understanding in initiating a romantic relationship is for me a way of building a sense of empathy and trust that's necessary for me to feel good about starting a relationship with someone. Creating an explicit protocol for that is sort of impossible. I can see why some people would want to make that protocol explicitly non-sexual, in that (a) having someone do something with a sexual flavor to you that you don't want them to do can feel bad enough that it doesn't seem worth it to set up a system where it's okay for someone to do something like that even just once as a test and (b) if someone asks me if I want to have sex with them I'm almost sure to refuse if we're not already on those terms through some other means.

I guess in general it seems to me like a protocol like this only works if you generally feel that more explicitness is better and you should generally be verbally clear about what you want and don't want, and I think that's only really true if you're a certain kind of person. Some people seem to argue that it's objectively the best way to behave, and I think that fails to acknowledge how this stuff isn't necessarily about like abstract value systems but more like basic personality material. I'm definitely all for more affection in platonic relationships and I love it when my friendships are super-affectionate, but I guess I have a hard time feeling comfortable with any sort of standardized system as people have discussed so far for making that happen, and when it comes to romantic relationships the huge variance from person to person in implicitness/explicitness needs, similarity/difference from platonic relationships, etc. would seem to require a completely different flavor of governing structure if it's even possible and beneficial to create such a thing on a scale that could encompass human romantic needs in general.

if today the human race feels like a rock falling from a distant cliff into the sea, perhaps tomorrow it will feel like the law of gravity that pulls all such rocks down.

things to think about when starting web project:

I think "queer" could maybe be defined more explicitly--your definition seems totally accurate but I'm not sure someone who wasn't already familiar with the word would get a good sense of it from that definition. Maybe something like "outside of a cisgendered, heterosexual identity in some way; sometimes used to indicate an identity separate from mainstream LGBT identities," or whatever, would give someone unfamiliar with queerness as a concept a heavier understanding.

Instead of (also a sexual orientation) or (also a gender identity) I think it might be more clear to say (see also under sexual orientation) or (see also under gender identity)--when I first read "also a sexual orientation" and didn't know that meant you were going to define those terms under that heading as well, I thought you were leaving out a lot of information. Obviously that's not like fatal or anything.

I think it could be worth broadening the definition of trans to include people who identify as trans without specifically identifying as m2f or f2m.

I think it might be worth identifying romance as "social interaction tied in some way to sex, or intense emotional intimacy in social interaction" or something, since it seems to more elegantly distinguish between the two ways people generally seem to feel about romance. It seems important to me to recognize that when romantic interaction is sexual it's because the people involved recognize or at least suspect that it has a sexual quality or link in some way, and when it's not sexual it's in the same way, no matter what the broader culture tends to categorize the form of the interaction in question as.

Involvement could maybe use an and/or.

Fidelity and Cheating maybe should be defined as keeping/breaking /such/ commitments to clarify their link to Relationship.

It might be worth defining Married as "in a particular legally or religiously sanctioned partnership or in a partnership deemed by the members to have a weight of that sort" or something to recognize that people who can't get legal and/or religious sanction still sometimes decide that they're married. Obviously whether or not people should define marriage outside of a traditional religious context at all is a subject of debate in the queer community, but it seems like we shouldn't write people who do so out of the picture in any case if this aims to be a neutral sort of glossary.

Obviously all of this stuff is rather subjective--I definitely don't have any sort of "objective" objections (hee hee).

There is a phrase I use frequently that hasn't yet become conventional, and for the sake of clarifying my speech, I'd like to explicate it. It's "surface scattering". I'll often talk about a certain direction of thought as "scattering on the surface". This is to indicate that I think it's mistaking the surface of whatever it's trying to understand for the thing's heart. This is easy to do since, touchingly (hahaha--but, really, puns aside, the patterns in this are often touchingly beautiful), the surface of a thing reflects its heart. In fact, a thing's heart is often most explicitly visible on its surface--but in an unpredictable fashion! You cannot understand a thing's heart from an understanding of its surface--you must use the surface as a guidepost to the heart and follow the path. Only then will you understand the mechanics by which the heart contacts the surface. Sadly, a thing's surface is a thing in itself, with its own surface and interior, and the path from that surface to that interior tends to be shorter and more obvious, making it attractive. There's no inherent harm in analyzing the surface if you know what you're doing, but if you do that analysis and think you're getting to the heart, you'll fill your container with the wrong substance. It may be so similar to the right substance that you don't notice your whole life, even if its subtle differences are fatal to your device. Tragic!

The visual metaphor I have in play is pretty clear (hahahahaha)--thought is construed as a beam of light shone upon an object that scatters upon it as it encounters reflective aspects of the object surface that it did not aim itself to avoid.

The Recipe

I feel generally less inclined to divide the world into dichotomies and take a partisan stance about them. I've always been explicitly against that attitude but I now see many ways in which I nevertheless embraced it when I was slightly younger, and I encounter this more and more as I go along, such that it seems quite possible that I will feel this way all the more in a few years. It's true in both little ways--for instance, I was always pro-cat and anti-dog, and now I feel that there is much to be gained from both--and big ones. Perhaps most notably I was (ironically?) anti-academic during most of my time as an undergraduate, and if anything this was a conviction that deepened over time--by the point of my graduation I was convinced that the entire academic world was hopelessly insular and unable to focus on the most essential and vital aspects of life in any discipline. Now I feel more ambivalent--I haven't necessary acquired the opposite conviction, but I wouldn't embrace that one now with such confidence. In truth it all seems more nuanced--having spent time in the world outside and gotten a sense of how the world generally lacks that focus but displays it in certain avenues here and there, it seems almost banally clear that the same would be true in academia. Looking at my experiences in retrospect and examining contemporary academic output now, I definitely see those patterns, often in places where as a student my attention was too heavily occupied by my general distress to notice them.

Of course it's very melodic--perhaps too melodic. In some ways I feel dissatisfied with the simplicity of the harmony without something thornier to contrast it--this will certainly lead me to write a more harmonically intricate movement following it but I'm not sure at this point if it will move me to revise the first movement in that direction or if in writing that other movement this dissatisfaction in me will be placated.

Well, if you say "I'll put mine up against any woman's" with regards to IQ, the most obvious interpretation of that seems to me to be that you are claiming as Faine also saw that you feel you could best any woman in an IQ test. I've always heard people use the phrase "I'll put my (x) up against (y category that encompasses x)" to indicate that they have confidence that their (x) will come out on top. But later on you claimed that what you meant was that your IQ "is still high compared to anyone's." Why didn't you just say that at first? Again, the merits of that comment notwithstanding, it just isn't subject to the same definitely obvious interpretation that Faine and I both gave your original comment. You went on to say "We were just talking IQ scores, and a score is a score, so I can be confident of that. As far as real 'intelligence' goes, that can best be measured in a variety of different ways, and of that I'm not always so assertive." But in that case, why do you care about IQ at /all/, if it's not a good standalone measure of real intelligence? Logically you'd see this article and just say "huh, poppycock" to yourself and keep going with your life. Your clarifications seem to redefine your opening statements in a way that vanishes them. 

It's extremely difficult for me to believe that you could really say ""I'll put mine up against any woman's" and think that was so interchangeable with "my IQ is still high compared to anyone" that any reasonable person would assume that was exactly what you meant. Otherwise, your comment seems incendiary because it's just asking for people to come at you and be like "nuh-UH!" I guess then you could reply, "uh-HUH, my IQ is in the higher end of 1% of the population" but like what is the point of this if not just to have a spat?

I don't think anyone thinks you need to give "zombie like words of confirmation to what anyone posts"--there are a bunch of ways you could object to this article that I think would be way more likely to inspire a calm discussion by not encouraging a large group of people (or all people as you've later said) to have some sort of contest or conflict with you. You know, you could critique whether IQ is really a good measure of intelligence (you sort of did that already, I guess, but again it begs the question of why you've said any of the other things you've said). You could debate the validity of sorting people into men and women and saying anything about them that way. You could call into question how this conclusion was arrived at--James Flynn, the man quoted in the article, is a professor of political studies who has done a lot of work concerning IQ, but we are not told how he got his data or given any real confidence that his work has been good, so for all we know it's a bunk study. You could point out that it's an article in the Daily Mail. Are these objections valid and worth making? Maybe, maybe not, but it's safe to say that if you want to object, you have options that don't require challenging all women or people in general to some sort of "IQ-off," which just seems well-designed to make people at best perplexed and at worst infuriated.

If anything it seems very likely to me that for whatever reason you are mainly in this for a spat. I'm worried that you will just interpret this post as another "attack" and respond in kind. Even this could be a gateway into a calm, polite discussion right now if you want to read it that way.

Postmodernism is, of course, only useful like so far as an idea in that everything from the early 20th century or so to now can be called modernist, in that the essential modernist attitude, that today is unique and demands new techniques to be described (hence the "modern" in modernism), is vibrantly alive and I think any of us would be hard pressed to even imagine a future where it stopped being so. But there's definitely a difference in character between art from the early 20th century to WWII and art from, say, post-WWII to the 1990s when the internet came into being (obviously all this is painting in broad strokes and is controversial but the broad strokes are sufficient to describe the idea). 

slang: "vopsy" meaning "new, fresh"

"If I weren't on Zoloft I'd be weeping right now"

I have a pretty specific desire--if anyone can help me I'll be thrilled!

I'm looking for "ambient" music that moves forward in a periodic way. I say "ambient" because it doesn't really have to be traditional ambient (although it's totally fine if it is), just in the sense of being background-friendly music that can hold up to close listening but is easy to work to or otherwise tune out from.

To make things more specific, I want music where at least some of the parts move in periods, so like it has at least one beat, but without drums (or at least any drums that aren't very delicate), and not necessarily with any identifiable tempo. The two artists I can think of that fit the bill are Tim Hecker and Steve Reich, both sometimes.

Tim Hecker likes to create textures where there are a number of layered voices that each have a unique tempo--a fast-moving, thumping, but extremely quiet bassline, a soaring melody that moves at a moderate pace, and a background wash of noise that undulates at an extremely slow tempo are all common elements. Often they turn on and off at different times (larger-scale periodic activity), so one that was buried in the background will suddenly emerge in the front. All this gives his music a powerful sense of forward motion without a "beat". 

@Klomp, you might like Fred Frith, Keiji Haino, Uchihashi Kazuhisa, and/or Alberto Ginestera's /Sonata for guitar/.

Fred Frith was one of the founding members of Henry Cow. He's been a prolific guitarist on his own for decades. You might really enjoy the work he's done since the '80s when he first got involved in the New York Downtown scene. His output is huge and quite varied in style--it's worth exploring in depth to find stuff that particularly appeals to you. I've recommended his album /Speechless/ which I quite like and the awesome John Zorn game pieces album /Xu Feng/ which prominently features his guitar work (along with the guitarist John Schott, whom I don't like solo as much, but who plays wonderfully in that ensemble).

Keiji Haino is a Japanese guitarist who's also been active for decades. His output is perhaps even more varied than Frith--everything from drone and ambient to rock and blues to wild free improvisation. Generally his output is passionately emotional and distinctively his regardless of style. In the context of your post you might really dig his free improv (but you might also enjoy anything else he's done). He recorded a wonderful live album with Jim O'Rourke and Oren Ambarchi this year called /Now While It's Still Warm Let Us Pour In All The Mystery/ (they've been recording together in this manner for a while but this album is especially good from them). 

Uchihashi Kazuhisa is another Japanese guitarist who does free improv. He's mostly recorded with Yoshida Tatsuya of Ruins, who's an absolutely jaw-dropping drummer if you haven't heard him before. Uchihashi is tremendously inventive and dynamic. Check out /Barisshee/ from them, released last year, and if you like it all the rest of their output is worth getting too.

Alberto Ginestera was a 20th-century Argentinian composer. He wrote one work for solo guitar, "Sonata Op. 47", that I think is bound to please you. Its harmonic and contrapuntal approaches share a lot with avant-garde jazz of the '60s/'70s and it has totally white-hot rhythmic energy. David Leisner's solo album /Music of the Human Spirit/ is, I believe, the only album on What.cd with the whole piece. His performance of the Ginastera is phenomenal. Poulenc's "Sarabande" on there I think is beautiful as well and The /Suite/ by Ned Rorem has some really cool moments.

As a postscript, they're in no way avant-garde, but just based on the list of guitarists you gave I have to make sure you already know about Barney Kessel and Herb Ellis. Great bop folks--they both played in Oscar Peterson's trio at various times. Ellis grew up in rural Texas and his jazz playing has a neat twang. They both recorded a live album with Charlie Byrd called /Great Guitars at the Winery/ that I'm sure you'd find very pleasant.

Et cetera[/quote]Wow thanks, this is really helpful! I'll check out all albums you've mentioned :)[/quote]

It's totally my pleasure! Those albums vary widely in style so I think there's gotta be something in there you'll dig. :P I'm a guitarist myself and I'm very interested in inventive approaches to the instrument, especially from jazz corridors--such approaches have been little-recognized in mainstream jazz since the '60s-'70s or so, it seems like (if you can even say what mainstream jazz /is/ anymore, rather hard). At one point I had a very similar feeling to what you expressed--it was confusing to me that there seemed to be this great renaissance in avant-garde playing in the mid-to-late 20th century with widely appreciated legends like Eric Dolphy, Ornette Coleman, Sun Ra and the like, but all the well-known guitarists seemed to be fairly conservative bop players. As it turns out, the experimental guitarists were totally there and continue to be, they just went rather underground. :P

Anyway, yeah, thinking and talking about this stuff is wonderful. I hope you enjoy. :)

The Handsome Family's "So Much Wine" caught me off-guard&I was just browsing around and Gerdie Snerdliff put up what turned out to be Handsome Family lyrics, and I remembered them from the Cactus those years ago, so I looked them up on YouTub--and I had been looking at Liz things, she had replied to one of my statuses with "

I sang carols to the pigs at midnight on Christmas eve. I watched them being skinned last Wednesday." 

anxious at first; feel too close to civilization (cars in background, lights, etc.); breaking curfew; deeper in; creekbed; the sense of things begins to change; I feel more inhabiting and everything begins to emit its "glow" and resonate; I touch a small boulder and make "contact" with it; a larger rock seems to menace me but we soon make peace and I lay against it to cement our new bond and stare at the stars, watching the lines and helixes make their way too and from the stars and the earth; fractal patterns in the branches of a tree just like the branches of the river I saw from a plane; I stand in the copse and then feel I am ready to go back; I commune with rocks on the way through the creekbed; I give thanks to the creekbed before I leave it and a shooting star falls; in the trail back through the forest I become a huge four-winged raptor and spread my wings and crane my neck; I become a series of different whales and swim rapidly through a dark ocean; I walk on an infinitely thin high glowing line through a celestial void and the geometric shape of the universe changes shape around me to fit with the infinite narrowness of the line and my body change with it to various more ethereal forms less bound by physical constraints "sidestepping" the constriction; I play some idle hand games with hovering, circling gold coins, then balls of light, then metal stars, then leaves two trees lend me, and then give them back; I accidentally burn the foliage off of several trees with fire and extend myself into them to grow back their leaves and bring them into a greater lushness than they were in even before; using my self to inhabit and produce their growth feels akin to orgasm; I solve several thousand games of checkers on a gigantic board, then rapidly win a game of chess for the white side, then rewind the game and win it for the black side in another few seconds, then vanish the board; I play a gliss with my two hands on two huge, long harps on either side of me; I glow; as I leave the greenbelt, I exchange farewells with it by perceiving a dark rose enveloping the trail entrance and producing a like rose with my body; I feel the flowers in my abdomen and my head and sense my frame, and then I leave

11/8/08 was one of the best days of my life to date. I:

ran two miles while Liz took her self-defense class

walked to the abandoned fairgrounds with her in the twilight while a glittering mist hung about everything and the sharp colors of fall and orange lights on the horizon made everything along the walk on the railtracks there appear to be burning; the fairgrounds was one of the most beautiful places I've encountered, and is entirely otherworldly; Liz and I kissed in the tomb of a dark room deep into the husk of a giant wooden building that once must have housed hundreds of spectators; at the top of a tower she said she would like to be a ghost there, and I agreed that the idea was a nice one; looking out over the fields from that tower I felt terribly sad at the utter and total separation between my body and what I saw there

as we walked out, I thought of the first two lines of "Variance Elegy," and wrote the rest of the poem when we returned home

lucid dream!

was woken up, fell back asleep

at a party; imagery very vivid; thought I had woken up and gone there; consciously thought I was not sleeping anymore

had my top hat on and was walking around upstairs with it; turned to look at myself in the mirror and saw that I apparently had the head of one of the other guys at the party; was super-taken-aback by this and deduced that I had to still be dreaming for that to be possible (never done that before!)

walked outside and half-flew/half-floated off the balcony; very rich imagery; walked out in the street and flew around a little bit; tried several transformations without luck; decided I would use a window as a "portal" I could pass through to try to make one work; woke up as I was doing that

more logical and conscious than I've ever been in a dream; still not perfect (would've performed stabilization techniques) but much much better

making serious progress somehow

I miss you so dearly.

When we walked below those whispering rows

of corn husks waving so sincerely

as the sheepshorn fog fell in fluid rows

and wept bright tears on all our clothes;

had I died then, I'd be ecstatic 

as the brightest Leyden jar--

in an eternal return

to those rainswept stars.

A belief in God is a strange mistake by which we assume that, since the order we produce in the things we make came out of our consciousness, the order we see in the natural world must also have come out of some consciousness. a more graceful scheme is presented the other way 'round: the order present in the natural world gave rise to the things we make, too--we are animals just as animals are animals!

D2(,000 or so):

I saw your LiveJournal post, and I was going to call you to wish you well, but I realized that since you don't have your phone working I'd be shouting basically into the ether, so I'm sending you a Facebook message instead. Everything you wrote just sounded really shitty to deal with.

It seems funny how losing stuff seems like it's such a harmlessly absentminded thing, like it shouldn't matter that much because it's so easy to do, and so you get in this mindset where it's like the worst that could happen is you could lose your keys for a bit and have to spend twenty minutes tracking them down; I think it's so sort of cosmically unjust and disproportionate that an action (or, really, inaction) so slight could have such dire consequences, especially on an emotional level. I hope someone turns it in; even if it was technically your "fault," it just seems unfair.

Also, I'm sad you're not still in Austin on account of your headphone troubles, 'cos I'd gladly lend you my Grado headphones if you were; they sit lightly on top of your ears instead of tightly encircling them and they sound real good. I doubt you're in the market for another pair after just getting the ones you have, but if you are, a pair of SR-60s can be had for pretty reasonably on EBay: http://catalog.ebay.com/Grado-SR-60-Consumer-Headphones-/69802709?_fifpts=1&_pcatid=399&_refkw=grado&_trksid=p3286.c0.m271. If you want incredible comfort, getting a pair of those yellow Sennheiser HD 414 pads is golden; that's basically what I've got and I can barely feel my headphones when they're on. I don't know if we'll be in the same place while your piercing is still a problem, but in any case, whether you get another pair or not, you're always welcome to borrow mine and see if they help, 'specially if yer losing sleep for chrissakes.

And, everything with your father saying awful things to you and discovering awful things about that adult from your childhood and not being able to reach your friend--that just seems unreasonable, especially with so many non-social shitty things for you to deal with; it seems like you'd feel like you were running out of people to turn to in those circumstances, even if there were folks around. At least your brother's all right, but of course that wouldn't even have been an issue if he hadn't gotten in a car wreck, I guess. I don't even know what your relationship with that brother is like, so maybe that's not even relevant.

Anyway, if you want someone to talk to, I'd be more than happy (literally; I ain't just sayin' that). I thought your post was totally justified and it didn't sound whiny to me at all. I mean, you've got a great bunch of legit reasons to feel down--plus, feelin' that shitty at the beginning of a new semester on top of everything else has to suck.

Super-best wishes,

Zack

P.S. I'm really sorry about never responding to the comment you made on my last LJ entry; I've got a lot of social anxiety around written communication (excepting spontaneous forms of it, like instant messaging). I tend to over-agonize about the quality of the content and length of my reply, to the point where I end up penning several drafts over the course of a week or something and then sending none of them. I'm trying to improve, and in the name of such improvement, here's what I wanted to reply those few months ago, updated for present times:

"YES! I actually had a conversation a few days ago with Rod Russell, Zachary Ossefort's dad, in which we both agreed that Hemingway's brevity makes the emotional content of his stories, namely the desperation and constant loneliness, even amongst friends, of the Lost Generation, having had the vast majority of their faith in their ideals smashed to bits by WWI, viscerally palpable. Many more flowery writers seem to set up a kind of barrier between you and the emotional content of the scene portrayed with their burdensome language, in which you intellectually understand how the scene feels but do not feel that way yourself; Hemingway seems just the opposite, searing right past the cold intellect and straight into the heart. What is not to love, indeed!

I'm glad you're so pleased by my bon-bon blueprints! And the sea, for that matter, which I do hold so dear. Sadly, the sweet machinery incorporating my candy proto-empire has still not yet been spun, sugar-like, into action. I came to the conclusion that the composition of the musical portion of my thesis (which is the great bulk of it) was too great a time-suck, and planned to start things off once it was finished, which thankfully should be quite soon (a matter of a few weeks). That said, I am all at the ready; I have my molds, giant restaurant-stock cast aluminum pots, and four pounds of Ecuadorian couverture, and have even completed the test-kitchening and recipe for my first bon-bon, an Orange and Irish Breakfast blend. I went so far as to draft a fancy-shmancy description for it, which currently is as follows:

'The strong aroma of organic California Valencias soars in front, followed by a flash of the bold, brisk taste of a select blend of Irish Breakfast teas, which gives way to a creamy, malty finish resembling the flavor of a good stout.'

I have also had that sense of our alikeness! Despite what I suppose have been rather limited interactions, I have often thought we seemed on the same page in many ways. I don't know if I am more daring or passionate than you, though I appreciate the compliment; after all, you're in pre-med, which seems like an impossibly daunting pursuit to me.

Thankee--I'll do my best to oblige, and I hope to hear more of yours as well! 'S always a pleasure."

P.P.S. I am also terribly sorry that I never sent you those mix CDs I promised you for your birthday over a year ago! I have never forgotten, though maybe that makes it worse. For ages, I had decided I wouldn't mention it until I had the whole thing finished and just surprise you, but at this point I think you are definitely owed a well-overdue apology. I have a similar problem with mix CDs as I do with written communication--in the past I have spent over sixty hours on mixes that are sometimes not even more than a half-hour long, to the detriment of Things--which falls under the same category of personal dynamics I'm trying to improve, and I promise I'll send a flurry of custom-tailored mixes your way soon. If you have any new requests for artists/songs/genres/mix themes/anything else you'd like included, please do send them my way.

In closing, I've compiled a few songs that I hope might please you in this context; they each in their own way kind of present a perspective on having an overwhelming shitty time. Here's the link; I hope you enjoy: http://www.mediafire.com/?nagomzwonwa

Hey Allison, it's Zack--my mom realized that she couldn't do the car thing tomorrow, although she can on Wednesday, so unless one of your folks will be around so I can test-drive it (in which case I'll still come if you tell me), I'll have to come Wednesday. I'm really sorry--only just found out. I hope it's not any trouble. --Zack

DON'T FORGET TO CANCEL AMAZON PRIME TRIAL -- ADD A CALENDAR REMINDER -- A MONTH FROM MAR. 30TH1

started w/ pilgrims -- new world as part eden, part wilderness (land of satan)

1800s -- continuation, but changed: more dominating, land is ours and must be conquered and claimed from coast to coast, technological progress, stewardship

early-mid 20th century -- standardization/quantification? systemization? now that we own the land, must understand it and regulate it as well as possible--make it "civilized" (still conquering wilderness)?

late 20th century/present -- fears of alienation from nature, fears that society is "ruining" or "damaging" nature, sense of obligation stemming from total stewardship and sense of failure therein

gradient from being lost in land/land being vast and incomprehensible/at war with the land to sense of total ownership and understanding of land to the point of abstraction (both of us away from the land and of the "spirit" of the land itself)

1.

a. thesis: gradient

b. road map: pilgrims -- terror, wonder, wilderness, eden, 1800s -- domination, push towards manifest destiny, increase of technological progress, feeling that control of land is within our grasp, early 20th century -- destiny fulfilled, control utilized in systems of quantification, zoning, land analysis, late 20th century/now -- sense of total control, alienation from "true" landscape (romanticization) owing to dwelling in abstractions, sense of mismanagement of land (but implied ability to truly manage land) (remember to mention that lines are not so clear-cut as these date categories imply, and that the term "gradient" is used for a reason)

c. terms: gradient, nature

2. resources/evidence: Pilgrims -- New England Forest, Mark Stoll (maybe), 1800s -- West as America, early 1900s -- rise of urban planning (olmsted? urban parks?), establishment of national park service, late 1900s/21st century -- self-evident

3. paper views america as a relatively homogenous body -- necessary for its scope, but certainly limiting, as there has been no limit of strife and dissension at any of these times; does not directly address economic changes (capitalism, etc.) which would be beneficial further analysis (stoll, cronon, etc.); one might argue that the fundamental relationship with nature (in which we are in it but apart from it) has remained constant the whole time, but paper does not really refute that point; early americans mainly puritans/new englanders excluding others at the time

4. 

: the pre-Revolution era of the Pilgrims, in which the natural world of America is seen both as an Eden-like haven overflowing with Gods bounty and an imposing chaotic wilderness to be conquered by civilization (both viewpoints characterized by an awe of the nature of America and a sense of immense scale dwarfing the new civilization within it), the period post-Revolution to the late 1800s, in which the natural world is seen as conquerable by America through the spread of American society and technological progress, culminating in ultimately successful efforts to bring all the land open to America between the two coasts under American dominion, the period from the end of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th, in which America seeks to analyze, systematize, and quantify the lands now under its control, the vast settlement mission of America being seen as complete, and the period from the late 20th century to the present day, in which Americans now have a sense of having gained the ability to truly manage the American landscape and are struggling with feelings of alienation from it stemming from the systems of abstraction created earlier in the 20th century and a sense that, through our overarching power over the land, we are mismanaging and damaging it.

death

I put the golden fleece in the store-room and left.

As I walked back to my desk, I reflected with a despairing frustration that, rightfully, after doing this Cupid ought to swoop down and carry me off to live immortally in ecstasy. But, in the end, I had been coerced to throw the fleece into a gaping maw that, for doing so, would spit back at me a small pile of idolatrous tokens, precisely the same amount I received every two weeks in my paycheck, no more, no less. A true Hell! My heart was only kept alive by the sense that, one day, in the movement of bits too and fro, Cupid might indeed swoop in and say, "From this you are released--you are coming with me."

(VERSE)

it's a bit self-absorbed of you

to assume you know who I'm talking to

but that is your style

(another lyric in same style & rhyme)

(CHORUS)

so in ten years standing in that courtyard

I won't be there

I'll be (etc. etc. follow format three times)

or dead because you had the gall

to say that you should end it all

and snapped me like a twig some midnight

i swear to god: the saddest way to go!

(VERSE)

Hi Ann,

First off, I'm really sorry I didn't get back to you sooner! I didn't see your message in the first few days after you sent it, and then I graduated from college and since then have been staying at a friend's house in rural Pennsylvania without net access. This is the first time I've had it since then. Again, my apologies! I hope my thoughts are still helpful.

First off, my gut reaction about Timothy (from the little that you've said) is that no matter how committed to you he claims to be, if you've had as bad an experience with him in the past as you have, he probably hasn't made a full reversal in a year or two. It's quite possible that when you started moving on and dating other people, it really hit him that you weren't attached to him anymore (or at least were giving that impression) and that made him feel panicked and desperate to get you back--but I really wouldn't be surprised if he fell back into his old patterns if and when the two of you got together. In my experience it's pretty ordinary for people who have a hard time really maintaining commitment and honesty in a relationship to get really desperate after a break up and suddenly realize that the person they were treating like shit who was giving them all this love and affection is the best person ever once that love and affection stops; if anything, a lot of their terrible behavior in a relationship comes from the same lack of self-esteem that leads them to want that affection back so desperately when they lose it, even if they can't reciprocate properly when it's actually being given to them.

That, and it doesn't seem like a good idea to get married to anyone you aren't completely and utterly sure about at any point in your life, but, yeah, especially not in your early 20s! You've got so much time to find someone you can commit yourself to wholeheartedly --until then, you might as well give yourself the freedom to move between relationships and flings as they come. Isn't that one of the things that makes being in our 20s exciting and worthwhile anyway?

It's really sad, too, that you get along with Timothy so well given all that, even if it's also probably pretty wonderful to have someone you can click with that fantastically. What makes him a great conversationalist may have nothing to do with his capacities as a boyfriend; he could be the smartest and funniest person in the world and, of course, still not be emotionally healthy, but very attractive. He sounds like he'd be a great close friend, really, if he wasn't trying so hard to get into a close relationship with you again. Maybe you could still keep in touch with him in any case, if it isn't too emotionally draining--but if you feel like you're still pretty attached to him and it would be hard to talk to him without (a) him desperately trying to get back together with you and (b) you feeling pulled back and forth between him and your misgivings, it might be best to leave him alone for a while, especially given that you have a life to live that's right in front of you and not in Georgia. That, and if you're mainly worried about hurting him because you care about him and don't want him to feel bad, remember that you can't account for anyone's emotions but your own and you should put your own feelings first. He can (and should!) take care of his own--no matter how warmly you feel towards him. If he genuinely cares for you, he'll understand.

What you have with Nick sounds really wonderful. Even if it doesn't last, he sounds like he's treating you really nicely and almost certainly wants to get closer to you than he is, no matter what he might've said about not wanting a girlfriend and not liking comitted relationships. There are a lot of guys who say that because they haven't really found anyone they clicked with in a long time, and they've just been drifting from lackluster person to lackluster person, or they've been hurt badly in the past or have some other reason to be afraid of commitment (like, for instance, a cold or angry relationship between their parents, or between their parents and them, when they were kids, or some political ideology about the nature of romance they adopted in their teens or early twenties and haven't let go of). In any case, he sounds like he really likes you and you might be able to change his mind. Of course, he may just be unwilling to date people for the long term at this point in his life, so I'm not saying you should proceed as if he is, but he also could very well find himself backpedaling on that once he gets to know you better. He also might leave when his work is done, too, regardless, and there may not be much you can do about that. But even if it's just for a while, having someone to confide in and spend time who's nice to you and that you really like is priceless. I'd say try not to think too much about the future and just live in the moment; you can't really know how everything will play out and the whole situation might be completely different in a couple of months, so it probably makes the most sense just to enjoy what you have and cross what bridges you have to when they come.

I hope you feel better, no matter what happens. Feel free to get in touch anytime! 

All the best,

Zack

why is the topic relevant to my interests?

I am applying to this program to further my understanding and participation in the social sciences, to pursue certain theoretical questions I have about the production and societal role of art in that context, and through those pursuits to obtain a better understanding of and gather resources for questions I intend to address in the written portion of my thesis. 

I am interested greatly in the genesis of art. The mysteriousness of the factors that caused an artistic piece to be conceived of and realized, even (or perhaps especially) to the artist, as a topic holds a great draw for me. I have done some exploration of the intersection between the origin of art in the mind and religious feeling, as for instance in my included essay on Kafka, and am interested both in exploring that intersection further and exploring new avenues through which to approach the topic.

As someone who identifies primarily as an artist but who considers the social sciences an invaluable and vital resource in the understanding and production of my art, rather than someone who is interested in studying art from the perspective of social theories primarily to further their exploration of the social sciences, I believe I will be able to bring a unique and interesting perspective to the seminar. I am deeply passionate about the social sciences and specifically the topic of origin, and consider the work the seminar has as its mission to pursue to have importance to me both in terms of my academic work and on a level that is deeply personal. For these reasons, I believe I will be able to engage in the work of the seminar with thoroughness and vigor.

"I rose early in the morning and left La Illuvia, and to prevent undue harm to my pocketbook I paid 4 h. to hire a purely spiritual horse. Amongst misty horsemen it might have passed for a slight horse, but this horse had in truth been worked until only his spirit remained and upon this noble moth-eaten spirit I was carried. In this manner I rode into an opium lounge, but guests of an even more corrupt and downtrodden character than myself had been there before me, for the Secret Service had burnt part of it, and the members of Congress had set fire to the rest, so that between the two of them there was a perfectly good lounge reduced to ashes. It had just begun to bloom anew, for here and there a new tapestry or learned Turk could be seen unfolding and winking"

confused about long notes but now see that they reinforce the sense of the tritone currently being explored

had wondered why the aug. 2nd was important and now understand that it is because of the p 4ths

end seems to be a sort of recapitulation/compression of the piece; also, tritones follow step motion down to the original tritone

ultimately, this piece has almost a classical kind of form, despite being post-tonal

Moves freely from key to key

Uses tonal shifts to hold attention

Entire piece (expt. intro) consists of two prolonged approaches to the dominant -- never truly moves into another key, but rather temporarily tonicizes sonorities due to its pattern of chromatic ascension/descension -- ultimately entire piece is a giant perfect cadence, twice

beef broth (or beef soup bones)

 if broth from scratch, vegetable cuttings like onion garlic

 2-4 hrs., then strain

 let bones cool, then pull little chunks of meat off of the fat and toss it in the soup

or buy beef broth, or combo beef & veggie broth

1 lb. of mushrooms, baby bellas or crimini (white buttons are okay too), sliced

1 big onion, or 2 medium onions, chopped

8 cloves garlic, sliced thin

butter

olive oil

cup-and-a-half of pearl barley (regular barley)

same amount of white beans (cannolini beans, navy beans, or even great northern)

 soak beans overnight if possible, strain out water and rinse beans, and then cook with them, but if you don't have time just use a can and drain them well

 after soaking, cook for several hours in broth

3 quarts of broth, when beginning soup

1/3-1/2 cup sherry, less if vermouth

black pepper

thyme

tarragon

crusty bread

after beans cook for about an hour, add barley (if using dry beans), if using canned beans, put them in after barley is cooked

barley needs to cook for an hour

half-hour before barley is done, saute 3 tbslps. butter, glug'a olive oil, onions and garlic, let onions get translucent and soft, then add mushrooms and some more oil; once mushrooms are really expressing juices, add to broth, along with sherry

pick spice (th. or at.) that you want to be dominant and add twice as much as the other, add canned beans at this point 

serve with crusty bread

To cut (ha, ha) through this pop decadence, I have included something completely different to counterpoint it--and it does need cutting through, the same way it's nice to have fruit in heavy ice cream to distract you from the fact that you just basically ate half a pound of milk fat. After listening to Cut Copy for a little while too long, my system started to balk and as an antidote I pulled out some Nervous Cop. Nervous Cop is a side project of Joanna Newsom, Zach Hill (of Hella, drummer), Greg Saunier (of Deerhoof, drummer), and a bit of John Dieterich (of Deerhoof, programming), released pre-

spontaneous generation: concept that life spontaneously arises from non-life due to "vital force"; disproven by Pasteur who put broth inside a jar and attached a long, thin, curved tube that bacteria got attached to

earth constantly leaks hydrogen gas to atmosphere because of its lightness but also accumulates dust from space and keeps same mass

earth's atmosphere is mostly hydrogen with a fair bit of oxygen and other things; current atmosphere is oxidizing w/ oxygen reacting; early atmosphere was reducing atmosphere w/ hydrogen reacting w/ everything

miller demonstrated conditions supposed to exist on early earth could produce array of organic compounds

polymers -- class of organic compounds composed of small organic molecules linked in chains; chain unlimited in principle and will self-assemble given energy input

replicators -- polymers that can make copies of themsleves; can cause arrangement of chain of same kind of units (positive/positive) or different kind of units (positive/negative) -- DNA is a positive/negative polymer

replication requires polymer chains to form the basis of copies and raw materials used to form copies

production of materials necessary for replication takes place slowly but raw materials used very quickly; this leads to competition among polymers for resources and those that are more successful at obtaining and using available resources reproduce more quickly and in larger numbers and thus have greater and greater access to available resources

efficient gathering of resources achieved by breaking up other replicators; organisms that do this called 

heterotrophs

defense of resources done by surrounding oneself with a defensive shell; replicators today use cell membranes to protect resources and polymer chains

cell membrane composed of 

lipids

 (fats) which form spheres in water due to one end (glycerol) being hydrophilic and the other (fatty acid) being hydrophobic; arrange so hydrophobic ends touch and hydrophilic ends touch water

materials pass through cell membrane through 

diffusion

, in which objects move from areas of high concentration to low concentration and will move through membrane until isotonic if openings exist in cell membrane; requires no energy input but happens slowly; 

osmosis

 

is the diffusion of water molecules; materials can also be moved through 

active transport

 which require energy

important classes of organic molecules are 

proteins

, which are composed of amino acids arranged in a linear chain, 

carbohydrates

, which are aldehydes or ketones with many hydroxl groups attached to them, 

nucleic acids

, which are a nitrogenous base, a sugar, and at least one phosphate group, and 

lipids

, which are composed of a molecule of glycerol (3-carbon alcohol) and three molecules of fatty acid (long chain of mostly hydrogen; organic acid group on one end and chains of carbons /w attached hydrogens hanging off of it; usually have 15-17 carbons but can have potentially infinite amount

lipids

 can be used for long-term storage and store a lot of energy but are harder to get at than carbs; make up cell membranes; hormones are made of lipids

proteins

 are polymers made from amino acids (living things use same 20); different amino acids defined from what molecule is in the "R" group position; in proteins, amino acids linked in polymer chains called polypeptides; bonds between amino acids called peptide bonds

protein structure: 

primary structure

 is sequence of amino acids; 

secondary structure

 is "alpha helix" twisted due to interactions of "R" groups; 

tertiary structure 

is "disulfide bonds," the alpha helix twisted into three-dimensional structure the level of which is determine by amino acid cysteine; 

quarternary structure

 only present in some proteins and arises when two polypeptides with tertiary structures linked together

humans can only synthesize 12 of 20 amino acids; other 8 called essential amino acids and most be obtained from diet

proteins used in body structure and to produce 

enzymes

, which determine and mediate what happens when chemical reactions occur in a cell; fit into reagents like a lock and key; each chemical reaction has its own enzyme and are reusable

carbohydrates

 are generally C6H1206; numbers vary but always same ratio; called monosaccharides and shaped as 6-carbon ring; monosaccharides linked in chains, two called disaccharide, many linked called a starch; carbohydrates first broken down into sugars which are converted into glycogen in liver or stored as fat; humans can't digest cellulose (starches) but some organisms use them as structural components like trees

energy drawn from ATP in organisms; all energy-generating reactions in life is to store energy in ATP; one production process known as 

glycolosis, fermentation, or anaerobic respitation

, which takes in glucose and 2 ATPs and produces a net gain of 2 ATPs, NADH, and ethanol or lactic acid; process is highly complex in order to allow heat to dissipate at each stage of the reaction

C6H12O6 + O2 -> 6 CO2 + 6 H2O

ATP -> ADP + PO4

ADP + PO4 -> ATP

NAD is a 

hydrogen acceptor molecule

 that receives highly reactive hydrogens

C + H2O & NAD = CO2 & NADH

(C6H12O6 + NAD = CO2 + NADH + C5H11O4

energy-assisted molecular transport

: 

facilitated diffusion

 goes with the concentration gradient while 

active transport

 goes against it; processes mediated by proteins in cell membrane

cyclic phosphorylation

 (cyclic because cyclical process, photo because involves light, phosphorylation because it centers around attaching phosphate to ATP

chlorophyll-a

 organic molecule that is basis of photosynthesis

CPP 

process: chlorophyll-a is hit by light and uses power of photon to transmit electron to a series of electron acceptor molecules mediated by enzymes; ATP is produced by attaching phosphate molecule to ADP

basic formula: 6 CO2 + 6 H2O -> C6H12O6 +O2; opposite of cellular respiration

non-cyclic phosphorylation

 is process that takes place today; 

light reactions

 rely on presence of light; in first part, electron passed to receptor that splits water molecule; oxygen released as waste product; two electrons released one of which is passed through electron transport chain to bond ADP + P and make ATP; in second part chlorophyll-a recieves photon transfers energy to electron which is later used to form ATP; at end of chain electron received by NADP which bonds with the hydrogens in the first part of the process to form NADPH2; free electron from first part attaches to chlorophyll-a at beginning of second part; stores ATP (more than cyclic PP) and prepares materials for 

dark reactions

input: photons, H2O, ADP+P, NADP --- output: ATP, NADPH2, O2

dark reactions

 use products of light reactions for glucose synthesis; start with three 5-carbon molecules w/ single phosphate group; 3 ATP react with sugars, each attaching a phosphate; 3 CO2 molecules react, each adding a carbon to a sugar; NADPH2 reacts with the three 6-carbon sugars w/ two phosphate groups & splits them into 3-carbon sugars; leaves six 3-carbon molecules one of which is used to make glucose and other five used to reconstitute three 5-carbon starters

input: 3 5-carbon molecules, 3 CO2, 3 ATP, NADPH2 -> C6H1206, O2, ADP, NADP

corn is 1.6% efficient in converting sunlight energy into chemical energy; animals more efficient

photosynthesis released oxygen into atmosphere converting it from reducing to oxidizing; complex organic compounds not spontaneously formed in oxidizing atmosphere; chemical processes that gave rouse spontaneously to life can't happen again

2) 

bridge reactions

 (transport pyruvate (energy-rich mol.) from cytoplasm to mitochon.)

process: pyruvate stripped of carbon, carbon released as CO2, hydrogen bonds with NAD to make NADH, acetyl COA bonds to 2-carbon compound, C2COA able to enter mitochond., once in COA is released leaving C2

: physical division of one cell into two; doesn't specifically deal with DNA; w/ only cytok. one daughter cell has DNA and other does not; mammal red blood cells divide this way; no nuclei, short lifespan

mitosis

: creates genetically identical copy of parent cell; genetic material divided up and passed on to daughter cell; when only mitosis occurs cell ends up with two nuclei (human cardiac muscles divide this way)

usually cytokinesis and mitosis are linked in 

ek.

 cell division

DNA

: dived into chromosomes, most human cells have 46 ('cept reproductive cells), chrom. found in nucleus, cell division must maintain same number

mitosis steps:

1) 

prophase

chromosomes have duplicated and are bundled in chromatids (pairs) held by centromere; centrioles move to either side of cell and produce connecting spindle fibers

2) 

metaphase

chromosomes line up alone equator of cell and attach to spindle fibers at centromere

3) 

anaphase

centromeres split and chromatids move apart toward opposite ends of cell

4) 

telophase

nucleus forms at each end of cell around chrom.; spindle fibers disappear; inverse of prophase

cytokinesis 

occurs during anaphase and telophase; cell membrane constructed between two nuclei and close off each half of cell

in plant cells, no centrioles, but still spindle fibers (don't need centrioles); build both cell membrane and cell wall dividing daughter cells

pk. cell division

 known as 

fission

DNA structure

: 

PO4

,

 deoxyribose 

(5-carbon sugar), and

 nitrogenous bases 

(

purines

, have 6-carbon ring attached to 5-carbon ring, include 

adenine

 and 

guanine

, and 

pyrimidines

, have 6-carbon ring, include 

thymine

 and 

cytosine

)

nucleotide 

is basic unit of DNA, consisting of phosphate, deoxyribose and base distributed in 1:1:1 ratio; usually named for letter of base (A,G,T,C)

DNA is polymer of nucelotides; nucl. linked in long chains; complimentary distribution of base pairs (A & T always in equal ratio, C & G same)

DNA forms double-helix due to interference/attraction between nitrogenous bases, twisting the molecule; bases attached with weak bonds, A to T, C to G

Mendel

 thought "red particle" caused red color and "white particle" caused white color; not accurate but saved appearances; hit on dominance and recessiveness

phenotype

 is an expressed trait; 

genotype

 are the genes that express it; 

alleles

 are different forms of the same gene type (dominant and recessive, for instance the genes for red and white, i.e. W = red, w = white)

genotypes 

can be 

homozygous dominant

, 

homozygous recessive

, or 

heterozygous

phenotype

 can be predicted if 

genotype

 is known

Mendel's law of Seg.: 

each allele has an equal chance of being passed on

Mendel's law of Independent Assort.

: genes inherited independent of one another

chromosome number

: 

diploid number

: number of chromosomes when each is doubled, as in an interphase cell (human diploid number is 48); 

haploid number

 is number of chrom. when not doubled as in gametes

mitosis

 prod. two diploid daughter cells w/ same # of chrom. as parent

meiosis

 prod. 4 gametes (sperm/egg cells), halves # of chrom.; during sexual reprod., two gametes fuse, restoring diploid #

copying chromosomes

: DNA strand unzipped and DNA polymerase attaches free nucleotides to each strand, then double-stranded chrom. attached with centromere

meiosis

: in 

prophase

, pairs of chromosomes form (called synapsis, pair of chrom. called tetrad); in 

metaphase

, tetrads line up across equator and spindles attach; in 

anaphase

 centromeres do not split and one chrom. is pulled to either side of cell; in 

telophase

 chrom. do not appear and nuclei do not form, 2 haploid cells produced; two cells then undergo v. II of each step to prod. total of 4 haploid cells

incomplete dominance -- varying degrees of expression/also called dose-effect

multiple alleles/codominance -- can have more than two alleles of a gene; multiple alleles can have an effect in the presence of each other, like in blood type

multiple genes -- traits controlled by multiple genes that may each have multiple alleles, like skin color which is controlled by several genes and is a dose effect

human sex determination -- 22 autosomes, 1 pair of sex chromosomes

sex-linkage -- genes on a sex chromosome that make one or another gender predisposed to having it

triploidy -- three sets of chromosomes; can't reproduce sexually/can only perform mitosis; all female and produce triploid eggs asexually

trisomy is an extra specific chromosome; triploidy is an extra set of chromosomes

crossing over -- chromosomes can get tangled up during metaphase in meiosis and sections of each chromosome can break off and reattach at the same point on a complimentary chromosome

genes located on chromosomes made of DNA; sequence of four nucleotides, A, T, G, and C; nucleus of cell controls what it does

DNA describes what enzymes are produced; enzymes are proteins that mediate chemical reactions in cells; 20 different amino acids are used

two kinds of nucleic acid, DNA and RNA

chromosomal DNA is located in the nucleus and never leaves

ribosomes, another organelle, produce the actual proteins and are located in the cytoplasm

RNA (ribonucleicacid) is similar to DNA but is used to transmit information to the ribosomes so proteins can be produced

 RNA: strands are short compared to chromosomes, is single-stranded, contains uracil in place of thymine (uracil behaves like thymine but is chemically different, small enough to move through pores of nuclear membrane

transcription (making RNA): DNA is unzipped into two single strands, free nucleotides attach to single strand (uracil attaching to adenine instead of thymine) -- RNA made in nucleus is called mRNA (messenger RNA) and is able to pass through the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm

translation (making proteins): mRNA attaches to a ribosome, which uses transfer RNA (tRNA) consisting of three RNA nucleotides and an amino acid, to make proteins -- mRNA moves through ribosome and tRNA attaches to three nucleotides at a time of it, carrying amino acids and linking them together in the proper sequence; the end result is a protein

evolution occurs thusly:

variation exists between members of a species

overpopulation; not all members will survive

competition for resources within a species

only fittest organisms for environment will survive

these organisms will pass on their traits to offspring & will reproduce more

speciation:

allopatric -- occurring due to geographic isolation; involves the founder effect, in which a smaller-than-average chunk of a population is geographically isolated from the bulk of the species, and due to an unusual genetic distribution (smaller size of pop.) and difference in environment the two groups will become different species if given enough time

sympatric -- occurring due to sexual selection; one gender of a species selects for certain characteristics in the other gender that cause the species to evolve in a certain direction and can also split it (if two groups of a sex select for two conflicting characteristics--one prefers blue color and the other prefers red--than the red and blue groups of the opposite sex will become further and further distinct from one another and eventually the selecting sex may not mate with those of its non-preferred color at all, causing the two to become reproductively isolated)

nutrient cycles:

nitrogen -- fixed by nitrogen-fixing bacteria from the atmos.

phosphate -- in sea creature bones, phosphate rocks, guano

carbon -- form of c02 in atmos., taken up by autotrophs; ends up on bottom of ocean and becomes limestone; not limiting; another reservoir is fossil fuels

trophic cascade -- change on one trophic level causes changes on all other levels

bi--or like ""pan""---sexual* &

*I am really not that into either of those terms honestly--"bi-" because it denotes a binary gender paradigm that I have at best very mixed feelings about and definitely don't want to use to define myself fundamentally in that way and "pan-" because it has this like loosey-goosey earth person vibe to me although in like very basic terms I guess it does a better job

Boston Song

I took the train to Boston;

went to see the city there.

All the folks behind glass windows,

cats and mudlarks, kings and minnows,

sought a spot, and sat, and stared.

I came with my hat on:

sweetest Homburg, softest sheathing.

Shining coat slipped down my shoulders

Shoes the blackest; street, it smolders!

'Gainst my side-arm: softly breathing.

Slowly I sought out Jack Lemmon,

pushed through time to Plath and Poe.

Thought I'd be the great equator,

fortune's great exterminator,

solving fame to flat plateau!

But folk rose up in loss, gone

feral as the figures fell.

Cats all clawed, mudlarks a'scratching,

King's an army, minnows hatching,

sung to spell my toll to tell.

Not long then was dirt tossed on;

lacking hallowed folk to crave

a word was spoke, and I fell in,

soon stripped of all my bones and skin,

spending time in Boston's grave.

I am talking to a new religion.

We spoke and I found my way down.

essence of Carl's concept: beyond just telling parents of adolescents to "lay off" their children and avoid umbrella parenting, actively encourage them to be supportive of what their children want to do field-wise (art, athletics, academia, etc.) without becoming controlling or manipulative toward their child through that field. this involves not only parents allowing their children to approach that field on their own terms, without detrimental parental involvement through projection, through instance (the parent attempts to supplant the child's goals with their own goals or desires in that field by forcing or coercing their child to follow a path envisioned by them), but also by ensuring that parents have an adequate and current knowledge of the realities of the field in the present day, as parents frequently have an understanding of that field that is surface-level, outdated, biased, or otherwise compromised. furthermore, parents may believe that their knowledge is proficient or prolific, possibly more so than that of their child, such that they believe they "know better" than their children and so feel justified in authoritatively directing their child down a certain path. also, these misunderstandings may give rise to unrealistic expectations that they may hamper their children with through active control of their children or even through imparting those expectations to their children, who may take them as valid. if parents are educationally (as opposed to therapeutically) provided with tools and a framework for understanding the realities of their child's aspirations, parents will be more able to give their children the appropriate support and independence their children need to succeed in fulfilling their long-term goals and desires.

First off, I really enjoyed this; I thought the lucidity of your writing was awfully impressive and made this a joy to read. Your use of down-to-earth language and lack of unnecessary/impenetrable academe-speak I thought was very effective; it was nice to not have to expend unreasonable amounts of effort extracting kernels of meaning from each sentence and the thing felt fluid and transparent.

To ensure that this clarity is not imagined on my part and that I did, in fact, get what you're getting at, here is a summary of my general understanding of the crux of your excerpts: 

love phrase "television's cult of beauty"

in "enunciated beauty" -- could probably chose a better word besides enunciated -- "defined? singular? grounded?"

paragraph starting "so the spirit of psychoanalysis..." makes wonderful point concerning empowerment of subject

"

We interpret from the vantage point of being already-wrong." love this--very good summary of problems caused by search for inherent objective meaning in an inherently subjective reality

vase metaphor very fitting--also, is your point that addicted folk are not necessarily merely trying to hide an emptiness that all experience but rather they are driven to addiction because their emptiness is more pronounced than others, or that addiction further widens this emptiness? I am unclear on this point

discussion of Wallace quote seems like it leaves important things unsaid; good material but sounds introductory (as I suppose it would, being from the introduction), like it's setting the nugget of the argument up; what follows it? it seems like it ties in with the idea of terror encased but hidden in one's own psychic territory brought up earlier during the psychoanalytic discussion, perhaps that this terror is inevitably encountered when one ventures into territories entirely composed of one's own subjective psychic energies, as in dreams? is this right or am I off the mark?

ch. 5 sounds like it's off to a really good start--limiting power of language seems a great topic to consider given the discussion of subjective reality and inherent limitations present in self--language creating reality through limitations on figuration and so on (could perception exist without language? etc.)--wonder where you're going with this

addicts, through own limitations, create a hell for themselves--we can create whatever we want in theory but in practice an addict is too damaged to do anything but hide a private torture chamber?

when addict finally discovers own process (which is an unconscious one) they meet that horror they have been hiding in themselves

Oh, hey, you have the same birthday as my friend Shmirdelthorpe.

Birthday are definitely occasions when you feel like the world is feeling you. I'm not trying to be all Shakespearian over here but when I was driving to work this morning. I felt that the blend of the grayish blue sky acknowledges your birthday. The wind was singing a rhythm of their own and it was all soothing but hollow at the same time, knowing that was a gap to fill. There was some emptiness and there was joy.

Days when they thought we were too young for pornography. And days when you were too old sitting at the couch with cereals in your hand watching Spongebob and giggling away.

There were those who are filled with joy and love.

 

Those who are sad remembering someone, something and those who are lonely

 

It may mean a thousand things. It may come with a stir of various emotions but it doesn't really matter at all. It's your birthday.

Publish it. Write it. Sing it. Swing to it. Yodel it. We wrote it, thats all we wanted to do."

[] The fact that we are not acknowledging this and instead are framing this entire discussion in terms of money speaks volumes to the immense insanity of the time in which we live. Would you rather preserve the careers of stuffy media bigwigs or hear good music when you turn on the radio? I mean what the hell! In a proper world OiNK would have been heralded on the front of the papers as ushering in a new golden age!--which it did! It already has! We are living in it right now! Does anyone involved in this conversation in any public capacity realize that?

I am an artist inasmuch as I am a person who makes art. Am I a professional? Absolutely not--I work day jobs. Would I like to become a professional? Absolutely--it would give me more time to devote singularly to art. Someone might assume that a person in my position, "wanting to "make it," would cringe at the idea of a bunch of e-folks swapping my art amongst themselves without ever paying me for it. Horseshit! It's a bunch of unfortunate nonsense and I don't understand why so many droves seem to make exactly that assumption.

[]

Who of you would rather have a decent paycheck and access to great art over a large paycheck and access to only shitty art? Please raise your hands, if you'd be so kind. Yeah, that's what I thought! Jesus Christ, human beings! Let's put our money where our mouths are on this one!

[]

Say I am composing a piece and as part of my work for it I decide to analyze <contemporary composer's /piece x/> to better understand its compositional techniques. I look around online and discover that the only way to obtain a copy of the score is through a publisher in Switzerland who will ship me a copy of the score in three to six weeks for $60. I don't have sixty dollars to spend on any sort of non-living expenses this month and I could be well into a first draft of my piece by the time the score came in the mail if I did. Fuck that! I look around and realize that the score is on What, for free, and I can download it in two seconds. In the long term, this process will allow me to produce more artwork in my lifetime, simply by shortening time spent waiting on the banal.

Now, you might say that this action is hurting <c.c.> by cutting into the money they need to make to get by through their work. But <c.c> certainly doesn't make anywhere near the bulk of their income from score sales--aside from the people performing their pieces, almost nobody buys them, which is why they're being sold by an obscure Swiss publisher. <C.c.> makes their bread and butter from their university post, grants, and commissions, none of which can be shared on trackers. What you would really be saying is that it is of top-level importance for <c.c> to be able to generate as much cash from their work as they possibly can--not enough to live on, not enough to sustain their composition career comfortably, even, but as much as they possibly can, all removable barriers removed. So: should we ask <c.c.> to give up a small part of the potential profits of their work for the good of the musical community at large? Not all of it--a very small part, one with little commercial value but immense cultural value. Yes! Of course we should! What is wrong with everybody?

We need to get over the idea that everyone should be able to get as rich as they want period and that that is the most important ability we could grant anyone ever. There are more important things. The cost of affording that people that luxury is immeasurably high to us as a species. It is not worth it. We could have a few hundred super-rich, a few thousand mega-rich, and millions of poor, or a large middle class with the world's largest library available to all for free instantaneously. !!??!!?!?!

I think the idea of "digital property" is just silly anyway. Worth seems to be derived from scarcity--something attains value when many people want some of it and there isn't much to go around. On the digital plane any object can be copied indefinitely, so no scarcity exists. Systems to generate money from such objects do so by introducing artificial scarcity--they must inhibit people from doing the more natural digital action of simply copying and sharing. This is not a new train of thought by any means of course but dang if it isn't awful relevant all the time in this conversation and I think tremendously undersaid.

Furthermore, that action doesn't inherently injure the professional well-being of artists at all. There is always a tangible, non-digital component to an artist's work if for no other reason than that a specific artist is a unique physical entity. Even if an artist makes and distributes their art using just a computer and generates no income from that aspect of their lives, they can appear in public, and for profit. Those who pay to attend such events purchase something of genuine value: that artist can only be in one place at one time. Their presence is actually scarce.

The physical world is already full of examples of this. Bands can profit through shows and merchandise. Authors can profit through tours and sales of physical books. Filmmakers can profit through screenings and panel appearances. Visual artists can profit through sales of originals and commissions. The list goes on through all the artistic careers.

The folks who actually have nowhere to go are, of course, middlemen who profit by distributing an artist's work to the public, often through old-fashioned channels. If these people are becoming professionally obsolete that is too bad for them but maybe they ought to go find a new line of work. A profession is only noble if it is needed--there is no reason to preserve it like an endangered species if society has moved on.

Will some people lose their jobs in all this? Yes, but they can find new, more useful ones. Will some artists who might've made it in the old world be shit-out-of-luck in the new one? Sure, but success is never guaranteed anyway . Would some artists who would have been rich be only decently off? Probably, but how much does that really matter? These costs are not the anything close to the end of the world compared to what we are already gaining right this second.

We are sailing rapidly into a brilliant reality, one where the sum total of all human expression is available instantly and almost wholly for free. We could become a stunningly well-educated and erudite species and in some circles this is already happening. Artists-in-training who previously would've had to pony up for a good university degree to get in touch with the canon in their field can now peruse the whole thing on their own with little to no resource barriers at all. Aspiring scientists can obtain textbooks and lecture videos that would have cost them tens of thousands of dollars total in the past. Brilliant artworks produced on tiny scales that would've doomed them to obscurity can be instantly transmitted to millions worldwide. This is a gain for civilization that far outstrips the telegraph. What on Earth are we doing whinging about "piracy." Sticky businessman can take care of their own--the rest of us, meanwhile, can study anything we want to, anytime. We already live in a new wonderful world. Lllllllllllet's foster it!

The Resonant Sphere is a space outside of normal space, but having a relationship with it and abilities to influence it, consisting mainly of areas of intense geometric beauty, cascading fractals, dimensions of infinite fire, and the like. It is able to be seen by certain individuals who stumble upon it, frequently by pure intuition, though an ability to perceive the Space can also be taught. It has a notable but mostly unseen presence in the world; most notably, radioactivity can be understood as a product of the Space bleeding into normal space through various Resonant substances, and nuclear weaponry as the outcome of letting a vast amount of energy from the Space bleed into normal space all at one time. A worldwide secret society, the Grael Group, almost exclusively maintains awareness of this space, due to their principle of inducting anyone who becomes aware of it into their folds. They are so named due to their regarding of the techniques necessary to produce nuclear weapons as a kind of Holy Grail, and their commitment to preventing the execution of these techniques outside of their proper time and place. They first allow the development and use of nuclear weapons at the end of World War II, considering it necessary to prevent an apocalypse in the form of an ill-fated world order at the hands of the Axis, though these events take place over a decade after <i>Milk and Scissors</i>.

The Trumps Society, re-named for a gained awareness of the Resonant power of the Tarot and formerly known as Barthe's Beuareau, are an adhocractic PI firm formed by Simon Barthe in 1906, based in Paris and mainly consisting of ex-patriots. They have almost entirely consisted of six members since their inception; the original group had six members and when one member would leave or died another would quickly be found to fill their place. Charles Williams later wrote <i>The Greater Trumps</i> first inspired by a vague awareness of the Society. They began as a regular detective agency, but after being hired by the Grael Group, they remained permanently attached to it while maintaining their technical independence, primarily solving cases of concern to the Group but also solving external cases presented by everyday figures that appear to have some attachment to the interests of the Group. They pursue cases in which some figure or society has both attained an awareness, either consciously or unconsciously, of the Resonant Sphere and has used it, intentionally or unintentionally, to manipulate the fabric of reality in a way detrimental to the interests of the group or humanity as a whole. These case are frequently of a beautiful and strange nature--if they are horrible it is only by incident, as people, including those most directly in touch with the Sphere, may die due to its intensely non-human nature, but that was rarely the point of what happened as it is in an ordinary murder, as such deaths that occur when contacting the Sphere are frequently incidental. This is almost inevitably true unless one person was using the Sphere to murder another, something that rarely happens within the vantage point of the Society, as this almost always occurs within the boundaries of the Grael Group and is such outside the reach or scope of the Society. 

<center>Cast and Characters</b>

<center><img src="http://forbiddenplanet.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/David%20Tennant%20Doctor%20Who%20TARDIS.jpg" /></center>

<b>David Tennant</b> is the star of the show, as Sal Eldridge, an American ex-pat detective in the Trumps Society. He is somewhat reclusive, and has a tendency towards spaciness and wall-eyedness; he began to see the Resonant Sphere as a young teen, and is greatly attached to its beauty, having a hard time controlling when he rises into it and becoming "lost" there sometimes at random. He might have an easier time controlling this if he tried harder, but he has something of a desire to be there always, and secretly regards the material world as a prison due to his attachment to the transcendent beauty of the Sphere. He was drawn to being a detective by a desire to exercise his analytical abilities and out of a perverse love of violence, but when he took a job as an analogue to a low-level case the Trumps Society was working on (which sometimes hires outside help, but does its best to keep them in the dark about what is really going on), he figured out a good deal about the true background of the case, and when he pressed the Society about it, they, heavily impressed, hired Eldridge to fill the place of the recently deceased Simon Barthe, both on the basis of his keen detective work and to keep him from spreading what he had discovered around. He is sometimes prone to bouts of depression that greatly reduce his ability to work on cases and generate friction between him and his co-workers. He is witty at times, having a dry and dark sense of humor, but is also hard to get along with, primarily due to his introversion and mean-spiritedness. He has no very close friends, though he is on good enough terms with some of his co-workers and is willing to spend time outside of work with them, especially drinking engagements, and is unable to maintain any romantic relationships he gets involved in for longer than a couple of months. He is an amateur poet, and episodes sometimes begin with him reading some of his poetry aloud, often as a voiceover with introductory imagery not depicting him.

<b>Audrey Tautou</b> is Sara Matthews, a co-worker of Eldridge's and the one he is closest to. She considers herself a kind of sorceress, and though she is a good detective she is really focused on understanding every possible aspect of the Resonant Sphere and using that knowledge in her day-to-day life. She is highly perceptive, able to pick up on the intentions and feelings of others with a great deal of accuracy, and is able to have a better relationship with Eldridge than most due to her intuitive understanding of human emotion. She learned her detective skills on the job, having become a part of the Trumps Society after stumbling upon one of their cases in the course of her quest to understand the Resonant Sphere; they took her on immediately due to her already well-developed abilities, despite her having no instruction in detective work. Privately, she plays the violin, but rarely lets others hear her unless she is close to them. She also draws well, and is fond of depicting the visions she has in the course of her interactions with the Resonant Sphere. She is a Parisian native, the only one of the main characters to be so.

<b>Philip Seymoure Hoffman</b> is Eldridge's superior, Mackenzie "Mack" Hamilton, a mid-level member of the secret society. He is jovial, considerably more light-hearted than Eldridge, and doesn't understand why Eldridge is at times as somber as he is. Still, they have complimentary senses of humor, and their extra-professional relationship is primarily maintained by their appreciation of one another's jokes and the shared interests that led them to their field. Little about Hamilton's background is revealed, but it is indicated at various points that he went into this organization following in his father's footsteps. His father is retired, but occasionally makes an appearance to warn Hamilton or Eldridge about an impending danger they weren't aware of; he also maintains a friendship with Eldridge. "Mack" Hamilton has an appreciation for the Resonant Sphere, but isn't nearly as emotional about it as Eldridge, and regards his job more as just a job, albeit a special and interesting one. He is a boatman by hobby, and spends much of his time when not working out sailing on the ocean.

<b>Bill Murray</b> is Arthur Hamilton, Mackenzie Hamilton's father. He is a supporting character who sometimes makes an appearance as an informant or as a buddy of Eldridge's, who met him at a family reunion of "Mack" Hamilton's that Eldridge was brought to as a guest. He shares the sense of humor that both "Mack" and Eldridge have in common, but is more somber, and respects Eldridge's sensibilities and mentality; hence, their relationship is able to go beyond humor into philosophical speculation, discussions of literature, and shared personal experiences. Eldridge hopes that as "Mack" grows older he will become more like his father, but does not reveal this to "Mack"; however, it does color their interactions, especially at times when Eldridge is in close communication with Arthur.

<b>Maribel VerdÃÂº</b> is LucÃÂ­a GascÃÂ³n, a Spanish woman in her mid-30s on extended holiday in Paris. Eldridge falls for her around the beginning of the series, and their relationship lasts for a few episodes, but even after it dissolves with GascÃÂ³n deserting Eldridge for his coldness and distance, they maintain a friendship. GascÃÂ³n pities Eldridge, and frequently tries to draw him out of his shell by inviting him to functions and parties with artists and world travelers. She has a great love of adventure, and will frequently go hiking in the countryside on her own or with close friends; one such hike, the only one she went on with Eldridge, throughout the countryside of South France and organized around the plan of working at and staying on dairy farms, remains one of both of their fondest memories. Despite her residency in Paris, she retains loyalty to Spain and an identity as a Spainiard. She loves the paintings of the Pre-Raphaelites, and Eldridge is always meaning to introduce her to Matthews, occasionally succeeding but never getting them to really hit it off, at least during the first season.

<b>Sheila Reid</b> is Anne Sally, a Scottish bookstore owner in Paris. She has a great enthusiasm for the poets of the time and is involved on the fringes of the literary society in Paris, being vaguely acquainted with such figures as Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, and even Marcel Duchamp. Eldridge comes to her for conversation, recommendations, and gossip, and likes to stop by her shop when he is puzzled by a case, hoping something she relates will spur inspiration in him. She bakes tremendous pies and sometimes brings them to work with her; Eldridge is always thrilled when presented with a piece of one of her homemade pies when visiting her shop.

Other supporting characters include the other four members of the Trumps Society, who cycle in and out as members leave or die, and various members of the Grael Group.

Episodes are an hour long and generally consist of a reading of Eldridge's poetry that relates to the storyline of the episode, frequently relating to intentional or accidental interactions with the Resonant Sphere, following which the case of the episode is followed and solved. <i>Milk and Scissors</i> is semi-episodic, with many episodes partially self-contained but also frequently relating to a larger storyline being played out over the course of that season or of multiple seasons. Season finales tend to revolve around the resolution of storylines, frequently those revolving around a higher-level person or group involved with the Grael Society going rogue or developing an ideology destructive to the Society or to humanity in general, especially those relating to the discovery or use of nuclear weapons.

The show's title comes from the song "The Dutch Boy," by The Handsome Family.

...In fact, I take solace in death, really. That might make me sound a titch disturbed, but consider: life is beautiful, and the destruction of the beautiful holds, in itself, a great beauty--so death is beautiful, too. This is evident everywhere, and can be observed quite easily, even by just watching daytime soaps.

They would never shoot her unless she attacked them, though they shoot other leopards without hesitation.

"dogs can smell fear; I can smell desire" - gabi

the vertebrate life -- excellent title for a thing

Last night, I dreamt that I was in a land that had a lot of shallow canyons; it looked in some ways sort of like a Dr. Seuss book setting, but with normal colors and less outlandish plants. Everything had that kind of twilight purple-essence-ish dream glow about it that sometimes happens in my dreams. At one point, I was in a very large mansion, but we (a small group I was with) went on a large treck outside for much of the dream; I think the idea was that we were traveling far on foot, and had some kind of mission or objective, as usual. Joanna Newsom was there and was a friend of mine; at one point, when we were walking through one of the long, shallow canyons (the main one we walked through, really, or maybe the only one--it had walls that were maybe only about twelve feet high, and everything was covered in a kind of very short grass or maybe moss), she kept walking or ducking into these alcoves in the canyon wall (which was very undulating in the way it was laid out--it would dip in and protrude out and such) in order to write songs. For some reason, she had to be there to do it; she would look up and if I recall correctly some console would appear above her in the alcove or she would be able to interface with some ethereal force in a visible way or something like that, and we'd have to wait around while she wrote the song.

Eventually, when we were walking around this canyon, I somehow got up over the canyon wall and walked across a rickety wooden bridge that went over the canyon and ended up on a rocky outcropping overlooking a thick forest. At this point, I was close to waking and became vaguely lucid, flew into the air, and began having sex with a sort of nameless woman as "I" fell. I didn't not have the sense of really being myself; rather, both people here seemed to be sort of nameless "insert" characters. I switched perspective between them repeatedly and then woke up. I had a wet dream, unsurprisingly.

fascist society

war; police & rebels (terrorists?) fighting everywhere

Brazil-esque

I wasn't fighting but didn't feel connected to or agree with the regime; was afraid of both sides

was with a group of friends who felt similarly; two of them (C.J. and Gabi) are friends of mine from waking life; we were all members of a kind of underground nonviolent semi-rebellious group who didn't want to adhere to the rule of the regime but didn't want to fight anyone

remember a lot of isolated images but am having trouble connecting them in any sort of a timeline; there are some intense "flashes" of memory, often from places when I was in danger

at one point I was in a large office complex performing some task for my group and got caught in the midst of a gunfight; there were long rows of cubicles and the walls were lined with large windows through which one could see the city; I was on the fifth story

the room was filled with soldiers/police and terrorists who rappelled down from air ducts in the high ceiling or came in through doors all around the room; the terrorists came in from the left side and the soldiers/police from the right; the terrorists were dressed in black jumpsuits and wore goggles and covered their faces and the soldiers were dressed in green uniforms; they all carried machine guns and shot at each other across the room; I was hit several times and fell to the floor but was able to get the bullets to slowly pass through me and healed myself, thus narrowly avoiding death; I'm not entirely sure how I did this but I recall closing my eyes and envisioning several orange/blue energetic spinning spiral "vortexes," one for each bullet, that sparkled and flashed, and manipulating them in my thoughts in such a manner as to drive the bullets through me without harming me; by the time I was finished doing this the soldiers and terrorists were gone and I left by getting up on a table against the windows and climbing into an air duct

I later met up with C.J. and a couple of other people from the group in a small abandoned grocery store where we were taking canned food to eat; there was fighting there as well and we had to avoid being shot in crossfire like I was earlier; we managed to get some food and left

later C.J., Gabi, and some other people from the group and I were sitting around a picnic table outside of another office complex next to the street and discussing our recent exploits; I talked about being shot and the other people in the group were worried for me and glad I came through; we also discussed briefly the obtaining of food and the danger present there and the luck we had in not being injured while obtaining it

Dream last night: Made out with a dream character I developed a crush on. Thin gal about my age and height, large eyes, rather bubbly in demeanor. We were lying together in and/or near the bed of an eggshell blue pickup truck. We were talking, and as we talked we gradually cuddled up with each other, then were talking with our faces very close together. The conversation assumed a higher- and higher-energy attraction undertone over time. Eventually we kissed each other almost without meaning to--we had gotten so close to that point that eventually we suddenly both forgot to hold ourselves back. We were both surprised by this (empathetic connection was heavy enough at this point that this emotion and the following ones were felt as viscerally common) but then were both pleased and then committed to actually just making out. We could feel one another falling for each other. I had the explosive, smashed-by-light feeling that accompanies the beginning of a new relationship.

dream:

brain had to be temp. transplanted into body of old man Nathan Brockett was close to who was dying of dementia so long-term surgery/operations could be performed on my regular body for about a month

when brain was put back into my body, one of best feelings; I made a list online of everything I had missed, like the correct patterns of (physical and abstract) light that form around objects and the smell of fresh dew

spent more or less the entire dream with Zachary during that phase (the surgery room/small hospital was inside Zachary's house near the kitchen)

previously was on a cruise ship with mazelike rooms; afterwards had to take a japanese test which I hadn't really been able to study for on account of the whole brain saga

I got into the test room through a hallway in the bottom floor of Zachary's house that led smoothly into a university classroom building and the professor was a very intense but kind man of unpinnable Eastern European descent

dreammachine visions:

a very tall tower, like a radio broadcast tower

rows of pinball machines

one pinball machine rotating and vibrating with intense energy

----

hawks flying all around, very fast

hundreds of black hawks

view pivots, hawks fly out to horizon over the sea, in the air on a coast

swoop over one large rock on small island ten feet off the shore

view pivots up to blue crystal sky, meteor flashes through

sea turns to ice, meteor strikes the sea which shatters

whole vision shatters in half, right half of vision filled with shards

landscape comes back into view but turns upside-down, part of landscape is distorted with orange light; world seems irreparably damaged

[b]Wednesday, March 12, 2008[/b]

[b]Living in Northern Japan[/b]

It was my second junior semester and

3/12/12

Slept for only a few hours--only the dimmest glimmer of anything (fairground imagery?) that may or may not have actually occurred at all. REM cycles possibly impenetrably short.

3/13/12

One dream recalled; took place in Texas desert-forest imagery (Concan-esque). Small settlement in the woods off a long highway. Beginning of dream recall had videogame dynamics with "assists" and "kills" in some manner; I got many kills but little assists, whereas Gerry, who was there, gave the assist for nearly all of my kills but got very little himself. Later there was a transition to people in the settlement trying to get a job at some sort of corporate food chain nearby--the job application process was driving-oriented and mainly involved a series of difficult driving tests. We all, but mainly Zachary and I, commiserated about the difficulty of the tests and hoped that we would manage to get work there. I woke up while trying to operate a sedan that appeared to have a single pedal for clutch and brake.

I have a memory from maybe earlier in the dream of whizzing along long stretches of raised highway imagery in flatter, less vegetated Texas desert imagery.

3/14/12

Blazer-Laser-themed; setup where arcade points got you cash you could redeem to play laser tag; Zachary was there; strange frustrating moment when was up against someone who only had the sensor at the barrel of their pistol on

3/15/12

Not sure; had some glimmers of recall upon waking but did not write them down fast enough.

3/16/12

A dream in which I was giving advice to the other people in the house, but in a different setting;

A dream in which I was considering Chinese culture and Chinese-Japanese relations casually in an Asian college visual setting;

A dream inspired by heavily magical Kung Fu movies in which I was climbing huge buildings and running on the roofs; dropping huge cinder blocks on a teenager from the top of a building; witnessing an evil Chinese general destroy twenty of his own men for insolence or incompetence with a spell that made them shatter like bottles of liquid, noting the special phrases used to cast spells and wondering what all these spells might be capable of--

3/20/12

Recall begins at a Mike/Katy/Ali/etc. social group party, in a city like a cross between Austin and New Orleans, at a house similar to Katy's mom's but that was owned or rented by one of the people in that group. I took standard actions for that setting--talked to Ali a lot, messed around with Katy and Mike some, etc. Eventually I left, because I needed to get somewhere else--something to do with my lodgings for the night, because I was visiting the city, not staying there.

I left into a quiet residential area in the mid-late afternoon, with the intention to get downtown, which was about a five minute walk. I found a route on Goggle Mops through a small park a few blocks away (first time I ever remember using tech like that in a dream--fascinatin').--

I am getting memories of earlier in the dream, which seemed before all this to be a gigantic trek alone through wetter, greener Central-Texas-like wilderness. Looking out over tall limestone cliffs, walking over smooth white stones in large verdant creekbeds, etc. It was all with a destination in mind--perhaps the city where the rest of the dream transpired.

The park resembled this scenery on a smaller scale and with more human influence--there were well-kempt ponds, some placards about the ecosystem, nice red-brown gravel paths. There were a few routes to downtown and the one I liked best was a small creekbed with a bit of water running in it. I walked along the stones being careful not to wet my shoes amongst a few other folks who were heading the same way.

When I got downtown I quickly boarded an apparently stationary bus and entered a new social area--Lillian Dawson was there along with a sort of beach bra type--bleached hair, tight tie-dyed shirt, sunglasses resting on brim of neon baseball cap, shorts, sandals--who was maybe her boyfriend (bizarre idea). There were a few other characters who I didn't really know but were part of the scene. It seems I was crashing at the house of the beach fellow and at one point I got off the bus with him to get some living supplies from the beach shop where he worked. We boarded the bus again which gradually became a solarium open where the back of the bus was. A small yellow wasp landed on my thumb while I was talking and stung me as I noticed it. I said "Fuck!" very loudly, noticed that the group around me seemed a bit embarrassed for me for swearing with such verve amongst lots of people in a public space, and expressed offhand that I maybe shouldn't be swearing so aggressively in public, which they laughed at. My thumb became throbbingly painful and the wasp landed on my head. The center of my forehead began to hurt, but in a more headache fashion--I wondered briefly in the wasp had stung me again but concluded that the effect was psychosomatic.

The dream began to dissolve and I had the always-strange feeling as I began to awake of remembering with a flash that I had a waking life, which I had entirely forgotten in my heavy dream immersion. There was still a dull pain in the center of my forehead, in the "third eye" laser cannon region, for around five minutes after I awoke.

dream notes:

went to Japan as a transfer student with Gabi

saw old host family

lived by ourselves in the country; misty, rainy

thought of staying there longer and taking time off school

dream notes:

went to desert on a sort of quest/journey with twelve friends (some from waking life, some not)

had to kill one in a wrestling fight on a dais & rock path to the dais out in the middle of a huge rock pit

had to leave shoes behind because we were in a huge hurry and needed to just grab my luggage and go (we all had luggage because we were going to an airport)

worried that me not having shoes would make a part of our journey later difficult (I think it was something that involved standing on a surface uncomfortable for feet for a long time, like hot rocks or something) but resolved to just deal with it

made it to small town & eventually stayed in a house there

was talking to Dara in the room I was staying in when it became like the dais before, with my bed being the dais and the floor being the pit, and fought Dara and killed her as I had the other guy, by kicking her in the head when she was hanging on the side of the ledge

maybe this has to do with my vision quest?

dream notes:

chefs/cloud castles/sky trapdoors/mountains/cloud cities

with gabi in a run-down dirty house with no electricity (very dark, extremely dusty, random broken/useless crap everywhere--seemed abandoned) where a depraved woman was; supposed to be visiting her parents; I thought the woman might be her mother but had no idea because she was so mad

told us that she was going to infect gabi's younger sister with HIV in order to slowly kill her and that in order to do this she needed some of gabi's blood

we understood that she would kill us if we didn't co-operate

she made gabi prick her big toe with a dirty needle and drain the blood into a plastic pouch; meanwhile she had me move a bunch of broken audio equipment that was cluttering the living room into the adjacent bedroom on the left (right when you enter the house)

afterwords she put the pouch on the floor and the woman wanted me to move it into the bedroom as well but when I picked it up it started to leak blood from the top and I realized it wasn't fully sealed; I told her I was going to transfer it to a ziplock baggy and did so with a box of them I found in the bedroom

at this point she said she was going to leave for a bit, I believe to go and do something (drink? fuck? like that) with a man who may have been her father, and that she would kill us if we tried to leave

when she left I told gabi that this was our chance to escape--she had a cell phone and we could run outside the house, find a safe place (preferably one with lots of people since she couldn't well attack us there), and call CPS

gabi was really worried and afraid of leaving but I assured her that if we got outside before she came back we'd be fine--it wouldn't be hard to find a safe place because it was daytime and we were in a suburb--and that the sooner we left the better of a chance we had; it took a little while but eventually she agreed

we ran out the door and around the side of the house to the left, through some sparse trees, across a street, through the parking lot of a grocery store, and into a small forest on a hill, where gabi stopped to catch her breath; after that we ran out of the forest on the other side of the grocery store and there was a big cage made of fence with a bunch of people inside it

as we got closer we saw two police officers and a bunch of people dressed in prison garb; all the prison folk were around the edges of the cage except for two of them in the middle who were boxing; one of the cops was refereeing and the other was ringing the bell

I thought this was a perfect place because of the presence of the police and opened the door to the cage; we went inside and crowded in with all the prisoners; no one spoke to us

gabi got out the cell phone and gave it to me and I called CPS; when they picked up the phone it was hard for us to hear each other because of all the noise in the cage so I stepped just outside it; I told them that gabi and i were trapped in a house with a woman who wanted to kill gabi's sister by infecting her with hiv and was going to kill us if we didn't co-operate and that we had just managed to escape; I got the address of the house from gabi and told it to them and they said they would send people over right away

now that we knew they would take care of that woman (her mother?) and the man with her (her father?) we knew we were free to not return to the house

I took gabi with me back into the forest and up a hill until I found a stack of boulders against a very steep hill/cliff; I had gabi follow me in climbing up them and found a trapdoor to the sky there, as I knew I would; I opened it, took her hand, and climbed through, pulling her up after me, and we returned to the clouds (paradise/food/etc.)

Inspired by the graffiti in the library bathroom at Simon's Rock, I have invented a new drink known as Earl Grey Goose. It is sort of like an irish coffee for classholes. Here is the recipe:

1 cup strong Earl Grey

1 (double?)shot Grey Goose vodka

1 half-lemon (optional)

Add vodka to Earl Grey directly after brewing while still hot. Squeeze lemon into drink if desired. You can add cream and/or sugar if you want I guess but then you would be making this into sort of a roy(e)a(r)l bitch drink (ha ha nested doublepun--one ha per pun). Enjoy if you want to/can.

Moving in to Eden's house Cons:

*Might be hard for me to have time alone/might feel self-conscious with another person in the house, especially one I don't know well

*Might be able to get a nicer arrangement

*Not on "the hill"; cell service might be fine though

*Would have to put more energy into maintaining the house than I would by myself (but maybe that is also kind of a pro)

*Might have to keep pretty quiet; this is mainly an issue as far as my drum kit goes

*We might have different tastes (I kinda doubt it would be a problem, though, again, considering her previous place)

Moving in to Eden's house Pros:

*Cheap rent would keep parents happy

*Eden apparently cooks a lot

*Another person around might keep me from getting lonely even if I don't know them all that well

*Wood floors! I may be unlikely to find a comparably nice place on my own

*Partially furnished

*Maybe Eden is really cool?

*Not too far from school, and near Guido's

*Eden would probably keep the house in pretty good shape, 'specially considering how neat her place with Laura was

Today

the Egremont fields stretched out before me again

staring me down like a lioness.

Yes, yes, that's right, I'm a writer.

I spent so much time as a musician

I nearly forgot my name.

An elderly couple lives in separate bedrooms at opposite ends of a gigantic mansion. They maneuver through endless sitting rooms and hallways to a gigantic dining room in the center of the mansion, where there is an immense long wooden table. They sit down at opposite ends of the table and prepare to have an interaction.

Thus, as far as I am concerned, art, as the pursuit that has as its goal direct action and construction within the most fundamental firma of reality, is the most central pursuit of human existence. All other pursuits are reflections or extrapolations of it, acting on higher, peripheral planes that resonate downwards into that most basic emotional firma, but are muddied by the time they get there. 

Often, I feel so uncomfortable at the dissonance between my inner goals, priorities, expectations, and basic perspectives on even the nature of extremely mundane and physical aspects of the world and those presented by the other people around me in our society that I take up the misanthrope's pastime of dreaming about fleeing to remote, little-or-not-at-all-populated locations where I can order my life and external space in line with my internal space without experiencing the constant shear stress that comes from rubbing up against a society that implicitly or explicitly tries to order that space in an alien manner to me and rub those internal characteristics in me that create that shear stress with it out of existence.

I recognize that creating art in such a society is in and of itself a form of resistance, as having a public life that explicitly makes aesthetics its ordering principle disseminates that pattern elsewhere, but I fear that my efforts will have as much impact as a drop of water in a sea of oil, separating from the whole to evaporate without having made any lasting change in the solution. It would take another sea to make that change, and I doubt any one person has the ability to create that kind of force without being a sort of explicitizing catalyst for the action of larger societal shifts and trends already in motion under the surface, which I do not see here.

To give an example of the essencing process, I'll quickly do a relatively straightforward essence--that of my own conception of a cup. A cup's a super-common, mundane object, so although it's usually sort of a dull thing its simplicity and mundanity make it a great candidate for an easy essence.

What do I call a cup? I know that a cup is, fundamentally, a vessel for drinking liquids. However, it is part of a larger group of such vessels, such as jugs, flasks, and canteens, and so has some characteristics that specialize it. Comparing it to other such objects, I can see that it is differentiated from them in two ways--functionally, the only abstract distinction, and morphologically, the only sensory distinction. It's not only a vessel for drinking liquids, it's a vessel for drinking liquids immediately, and it's distinguished from its cousins primarily by its shape. A cup could be made of all sorts of materials that other drinking vessels might also be made from, but for me to know it is a cup it must:

1. Have a diameter at the rim larger or equal to that at the base--otherwise it suggests a vessel for pouring, not drinking, y'knaw.

2. Have a rim that does not [curve inwards at the top]; this damages its function as a drinking vessel heavily enough to confuse its status as a cup. I think if I saw something like a cup with a lip that [curved inward] I would think it was a sort of weird, disappointed jar, maybe.

3. Be able to stand upright--that is, with the opening pointing away from the center of the planet or whatever you're on (cups are not generally made for low- or zero-gravity use; you might be able to make something like a sippy cup for use in such an environment that only released liquid if the opening was sucked on of course, and you'd still call this a cup due to its primary function).

4. Be thin enough at the rim that it is possible to fit the rim easily onto ones mouth and pour liquid in. An object that was too thick for this would be another weird anomalous object--a funky vase, maybe?

5. Have no associated lid or a lid that is easily removable and almost always still allows for drinking, via a straw or an opening; a lid meant to be secure usually renders the object a jar or a bottle. I can conceive of seeing a cup-shaped object with, say, a snap-on lid without an opening and thinking of it as a cup first and foremost, but I have never actually encountered anything like that ever, which just goes to show.

So, now we have the essential characteristics of the object! The time has come to test their boundaries. The question here is, as always: how vital are each of these characteristics to the object? Can we eliminate any of them and still see the object in question as a cup?

If it has a diameter at the rim smaller than at the base, it's for pouring, not drinking, and so I automatically see it as something other than a cup. This is because its small lip suggests that it is designed as more of a storage vessel than a cup. The first characteristic is vital.

If its rim curves inward, it is too difficult to drink from, and I assume it must be for something else, although what I can't really say. The second characteristic is vital.

If it can't stand upright, liquid will fall out. It's not even a drinking vessel. Fuck that--definitely not a cup. The third characteristic is vital.

If the rim is too thick to fit in ones mouth and easily pour liquid in, its function is too disturbed. The fourth characteristic is vital.

If it doesn't have a lid, we're good. If it does have a lid, and the lid is designed for long-term attachment--say, if it screws or latches on--it becomes a jar, or a can, or so on, even if it has all of the other characteristics of a cup. Such objects are sometimes similar enough that is is possible to "use them as cups"--for instance, you might find a restaurant using Mason jars "in place of cups." I'd be tipped off that they were jars by the ridges near the rim for a lid to screw onto--it's a cup if you can still drink out of it easily with the lid on. A jar with holes poked in the lid is still a jar, because those are too much of a pain to drink from, but if you put a straw in the hole, you are "using the jar as a cup." You still know it's a jar from the screw-on lid. But if the lid is snap-on and has a straw, it's a cup with a lid. Ta-da!

The fifth characteristic is vital, too, but it has some wiggle room. It depends on how easily you think a lid can be removed and how easy it is to drink out of the object in question with the lid on. Again, if I ran into an object with the first two characteristics and a snap-on lid with no holes, I might call it a cup, but I'd probably just call it a container and clock out for the day. You could probably argue that the lid of a cup must have either a hole for a straw or for easy drinking (as with a sippy cup) to be a cup, always, and I wouldn't necessarily disagree.

We are seeing a common and basic dynamic emerge here--the interaction between the abstract component of the essence (the object's function--easy, immediate drinking) and the sensory component (its shape). As is often the case, the abstract component dominates. What I mean by this is that the abstract component is most central to the object--ultimately, anything is (or can be or serve as) a cup if you can drink from it easily and immediately. The morphological components tell you whether a mystery object you encounter is a cup or not--if it fulfills the characteristics of our list, it's definitely a cup. However, someone can tell you something is a cup, and if you take their word, that tells you that whatever the object is, it's meant to have liquid put in it and then have that liquid consumed right away, even if it doesn't have some or any of the characteristics listed above (although if it has none of them you are probably going to react by saying it's a "weird" or "shitty" cup and not using it, by which you mean that it poorly fulfills the function it has been suggested to have). Similarly, if someone tells you that they are using something as a cup, you know that even though you might usually identify it as something else, it's being used right now to store and quickly consume liquid. And if you see something that looks like a cup, but someone tells you it's a container and puts a lid on it, you'll probably decide it's meant for long-term storage and therefor isn't a cup, even though it has the right morphological properties for one.

Now we can finish our essence! First and foremost, a cup is a vessel for quick consumption of liquids, full stop. Anything being used for this purpose is a cup or is being "used as a cup." If we see an object out in the world and think it might be a cup, we can be sure by seeing how well it can be used as a cup and whether it seems to be meant to be used more clearly for something else, which we do by checking its morphological characteristics with the list above. A cup is an abstract category with sensory implications--its essence is abstract, but it implies a certain sensory experience.

Yay, we're done! That's how you essence! If I ran into someone who didn't know what a cup was and wanted to explain it to them from my perspective, I could go through all that with them, and afterwards, if I did a good job and they kept it all in mind, they'd be able to identify cups in just the same manner I do.

[This, by the way, is often a good test of your essence; ask someone else to go through objects that might be on the boundary of your essence--like Mason jars, in this case--and ask yourself whether each of them is or isn't part of the category you're essencing and why, just as you would on your own. You might discover further characteristics vital to that object that you had been taking for granted earlier. [No matter how good of an essencer you are], this never hurts and is often helpful.]

Okay, let's do another! A cup is such a simple category that although it's great for covering the most essential parts of essencing (hahaha) it doesn't have some of the more involved dynamics that are vital for sussing out more complex categories. I think a good step up in complexity from here would probably be to essence a cow.

What do I call a cow? Ooph, this is already much harder! There's nothing central about a cow that gives it "cowness." I do know this, though: a cow is a cow because of how it affects me sensorily. A cow looks a certain way, it has a certain texture, it produces certain sounds, and so on. What's more, cows are usually found in certain environments--grassy areas where they can graze. I have some abstract associations for cows--cuteness, pastorality, farming, and so on--but they are broad categories that touch a bunch of things that aren't cows, and they can't be specified enough while still being abstract to include only cows--you've gotta get sensory with your description at some point or you'll always include other things that aren't cows. 

It's still complicated, though, because there's not a central sensory characteristic that makes a cow. Cows make sound--they moo, for instance--but a cow that isn't mooing can still be a cow. A cow usually has fur, but a shaved cow is still a cow. Female cows have udders, but even without an udder, a cow is still a cow. Cows usually have four legs, but a cow with more or less legs is still a cow, just a weird or injured one. 

For starters, let's list the characteristics of cows that let us know they are cows:

 1. They make sound. Most notably for me, they moo. They make other sounds, too--calves bawl, bulls bellow, and so on. All of these sounds are unique to cows and sound "cowish" to me. However, if I saw something else make those sounds, I wouldn't assume it was a cow--it might be a person doing a good cow imitation, for instance, or a recording of a cow played through speakers, or whatever. In the absence of any other sensory data, though, if I heard those sounds I'd assume a cow was around.

2. They have distinct colors. They are usually some combination of black or brown and white. Sometimes they have mottled coloring, and other times their color is solid. If I saw something that was otherwise cowish that had different colors, though, I'd still think it was a cow, albeit probably a painted or dyed one.

3. They are covered in hair. A cow without hair can still be a cow, though--a shaved or strange cow.

4. Generally, they have a roughly square-shaped body.

5. They have four legs. They stand on all fours and have hooves. 

6. They have heads. Their heads have a boxy, rectangular shape that ends in their nose and mouth. They have wide, squarish noses, large pink tongues, round black eyes set near the top of their head, roughly oval-shaped ears at the top of their head that may be quite rounded or almost come to a point, and sometimes smooth horns at the very top of their heads that stick out and often curve upwards. Their horns do not curl--that would suggest a ram's head, perhaps, instead of a cow's. 

7. They have tails that are smooth, round, and thin for most of their length and then end in a tassel of hair. 

8. Female cows usually have udders--large, roughly spherical structures in-between their back legs with generally two sets of descending thin cylindrical structures around the middle with usually a few inches of space in-between each one, which are the cow's teats. Cows are not the only animals with udders, but theirs have a shape distinct to cows. Bulls are known for having large testicles, in a similar place to a (female) cow's udder, but many bulls are castrated.

9. They often have a strong smell associated with them, particularly when there are many cattle in an area together and especially if their manure is present. It's a strong, musky, rather sharp smell, and generally not pleasant. It's distinct to cows, though other similar animals may generate similar smells.

10. They are alive. Cows are animals--they move of their own volition, respond to stimulus, breathe, are warm, and so on. They are social animals, so they interact with each other and often form large groups. They eat plants, often grass. They have varying moods and can be content or frustrated. They don't like to feel pain. They may have sex. They may give birth. A cow that is not warm, not moving, and not breathing is probably dead, and is rapidly becoming no-longer-a-cow.

All right, let's do some boundary testing! How vital are each of these characteristics? Going through the list, we can see that none of them are truly vital. If an object has all of the above properties, and any one is removed, we still see it as a cow. It might be a non-standard cow--a shaved cow, a very clean cow, a dyed cow, a sleeping cow, a headless cow, a dead cow, and so on--but still a cow. However, as we continue to remove properties, the object becomes less cow-ish. If it has all of the above characteristics except legs, it's a legless cow, but if it also does not have a body and tail, it's just a cow head, not a cow. There are a lot of things we could remove from the object and still see it as a cow--even if it has no tail, no hair, is green, is quiet, lacks any secondary sexual characteristics, does not smell, has no legs, and is dead, we still see it as a cow, albeit barely. Some of its characteristics seem to be more vital than others--if its body has something other than a sqaureish shape, it's still a cow (maybe a fantastic cow), but if it has no body at all, we really need a lot of other cues to still see it as a cow and not just cow-related. if it had all of the other characteristics--a cow head, legs, tail, hair, color, life, and so on--we would see it as a fantastic, bodiless cow. Life is the most important characteristic here--if the head, legs, and tail are still alive and function as a unit, it's a cow, but if not, it's just cow parts.

As we test its boundaries, a cow is revealing itself as a vague sensory object. As opposed to a specific sensory object, which has vital sensory components, we know a cow by the rough sum of its sensory parts. Vague objects can be "tuned." Think of a perfectly in-tune instrument; if someone performs the mechanical actions on that instrument necessary to produce a song you know, you'll recognize it as a spot-on rendition of that song. If the instrument is a little bit out-of-tune, you'll still recognize it as that song, but warped. As the instrument is moved further and further out-of-tune, you'll reach a point where you can barely identify the song, and soon after that a point where the song is totally unrecognizable. Vague objects are just like this. Each characteristic is a bit like, say, a tuning peg on a stringed instrument--as we adjust them, the object goes in and out of focus.

Each vague object has a slightly different tuning method. Some of its characteristics can be pushed really far before the object becomes unrecognizable, while others can only be pushed a little bit before the object becomes something else. Let's go through each of the cow's characteristics and examine how they can be tuned to produce a "standard" cow, an unusual cow, and something that is not a cow. If you were starting with a formless object and wanted to push it into cowhood, these would be the things you'd want to keep in mind:

1. Standard cows make cow sounds--mooing, lowing, bellowing, and such. A cow needs to make these sounds to be standard. If a cow makes sounds similar to these but slightly "off," we may recognize it as a standard cow that is sick or injured, but if it makes totally different sounds, it's an unusual cow. If it makes no sound at all, it can still be standard--we recognize that if it felt the need to make sounds, or had the ability, it would make cow sounds.

2. Standard cows are some combination of brown or black and white. They may be mottled or solid (brown, black, or white) in color. If a cow doesn't have these colors, it's slightly unusual. It might be a real, living cow we could encounter in the world, but it either has strange genetic traits or external forces (like someone with an airbrush, or acid rain) have modified it.

3. Standard cows have hair. If a cow lacks hair, it's slightly unusual--again, could be encountered in the world as a "real" cow, but has been born unusual or messed with.

4. Standard cows have a roughly square-shaped body, with the head at the top front, the tail at the top back, and a pair of legs at the front and back bottom. This is a pretty necessary characteristic. If a cow's body is slightly different from this, it can be a real cow (for instance, some Brahman cattle have a strange, wavelike hump), but if it is more than a bit different, it's a very unusual cow, probably imaginary, and if it lacks a body at all (if it's just a head, legs, and tail in a pile, say), we need strong other cues to still see it as a cow (it must be alive, for instance, which is the only other way to connect the cow parts together to make a larger whole) and it's still very unusual. If it lacks a body and isn't alive, it's not a cow--at best, it's just cow parts.

5. Standard cows have four legs. If a cow lacks legs but you can see that it used to have them--if they've been cut off, for instance--it's an injured cow, and if it seems to have never had legs at all, it's either a strange real cow, one born quite odd, or it's imaginary. If it has something totally different in place of legs, it's still probably recognizable as a cow, but a very unusual, imaginary cow.

6. Standard cows have cow heads. This is another pretty necessary characteristic. If a cow lacks a head entirely, it's still a cow--just a headless cow--but if it has something else aside from a cow head, especially if it's a different head, it's probably cow-related but not a cow. It might seem like a hybrid of a cow and something else. We put a lot of a cow's "cowness" in its head, especially its face. If it has a head that's close to a cow head but with some slight variations--strangely-colored eyes, weird horns, unusual markings, or so on--we may see it as a deformed or injured cow, or maybe as a different bovid, such as a buffalo. 

7. Standard cows have cow tails, but this characteristic is relatively tertiary. Cow tails are distinctive enough that adding a cow tail to something gives it a bit of cow flavor. A cow can lack a tail and still be standard--we may assume that it has lost its tail or been born without one. If a cow has something totally different in place of a tail, it will still probably seem like a cow, albeit likely an unusual, imaginary one.

8. Standard cows usually have some obvious secondary sexual characteristics, but similar to tails these aren't vital. A cow without an udder or obvious male genitals will still come across as a standard cow to the casual observer; closer inspection will probably suggest that the cow is a steer. However, udders in particular have a strong cow flavor; visual depictions of cows often show them with udders, even in situations where the cow may be intended to be male or at least not specifically female, and adding a cow udder to something gives it strong cow connotations. This may be because of the cow's agricultural role as a milk producer and the heavy influence that has had in the general imagination of cows over the centuries.

9. Standard cows often smell, but this is very tertiary. A standard cow may not smell "cow-ish." However, the smell is distinctive enough that if it is encountered by itself it strongly suggests that there are cows nearby.

10. Standard cows are alive or recently dead. The decomposition process quickly begins to degrade the other identifying characteristics of a cow, such that by a few weeks after a cow's death, even if it is undisturbed after that point, we are likely to call it a carcass and not a cow, though we may understand that it once was a cow. If it still looks similar enough to a living cow, we may still refer to it as a cow--a dead cow, probably--but pretty soon we will call it a cow carcass, and calling it a dead cow will feel a bit strange. Life is an important characteristic; if an object has some other strong cow qualities, we are likely to see it as a cow still (though not a standard cow--all artistic depictions of cows fit this model, for instance), but if it is not alive, it can only be recently dead to be standard. Life is the only other characteristic of cows aside from their torso that ties all of their component parts together--a pile of cow parts that is alive and moves as a unit will be seen as a fantastic cow, fit for a legend or a film (like Caroliner the Singing Bull), but without life and a central body we just have some cow parts, not a cow.

Hooray! We've essenced a cow. Someone unfamiliar with cows, or who wanted to model a cow, could consult this for a roadmap, although it would probably help them to see some illustrations at least. As with many sensory objects, to truly understand a standard cow you probably need to encounter one--truly describing the essence of a standard cow in as much detail as possible, so that someone who has never encountered a living, healthy cow would be able to convince others easily that they had, would likely take at least a book. Understanding a cow well enough to create an unusual cow, or depictions of a cow, may not require this. If you are familiar with standard cows, this gives you everything you need to suggest a standard cow, an unusual cow, or a different object with some cow features, and to know the specific ways in which adding, subtracting, and modifying the features of your object will bring it nearer or further from standard cowhood.

most bar exam sites don't have net connectivity

esonsitetools is most important util on flash d -- won't work until softest is installed

barse -- bar site engineer

tech assistance -- two fingers like a peace sign, not ordinary hand raise

when re-registering, choose name of applicant -- DON'T pick someone else

if exam files are missing or corrupt, use "customize exam"

 when doing this, best practice is to "customize" all files at and after that session (don't do sessions they've already completed)

if you see a red background during the exam, that person is taking the practice exam; go over to them, exit them out, and start them on the correct exam; scan the room for this at the start of the exam

fill out the incident report by hand, but have the applicant fill out columns last name through comp. make while you're diagnosing the problem; fill in the problem description while they describe it to you, then the resolution desc. after you solve the problem; worry about issue code later

when things settle down (15-20 min. in or so), go to site captain and let them know you're ready to enter your info; use your issue code sheet then to fill in issue codes

familiarize yourself with issue codes prior to exam day

last exam notice window is red stop sign window

usually antivirus is in system tray of computer (usually TrendMicro) -- disable it

 use flash drive, us esonsite, use customize exam and select exam file that was eaten by antivirus (don't do all of them, just that one)

only way to stop lag issue is to reboot computer (save first)

 beforehand, ask them if they want you to restart their computer, because it will take a few minutes

 shut comp. off (do a hard reboot)

 don't let it reboot into normal windows--reboot it into safe mode (press f8 repeatedly)

 

if someone starts exam prematurely, just tell them to wait and not do anything

in your state, applicants are required to back up answer files after each session

ctrl-b -- backup, can only be done from windows

on vaios and other laptops with sim card readers, two drives will be offered for backup; softest defaults to usb drive, so just hit OK

make sure everyone is using the bar edition; if you see a blue swoosh and the launcher screen, that's the academic version, so close it and have them use the bar version

if someone asks how long they have left for a session, don't answer, even if you think you know the answer; only answer tech questions, not procedural ones

bring snacks/box lunch

Also, the quality of the recording is such that the ride cuts through the piano far more than it would live or well-recorded--I doubt anyone would think it was a problem this was a studio recording or they were at the show.

"I built a foundry in the woods with my bare hands and then used my bare hands to manipulate its tools in such a way as to produce this fan you hear, in order to play my musical piece

Q: What's up with the name of your website?

A: It's a triple-portmanteau (za(ck)-anderson-song) made from my first two initials and last name (z. g. anderson) re-arranged. The reason for the musical theme (ha! ha!--it's not a musical theme at all, it's a linguistic one!) should be obvious.

Q: Why are you so crazy? You sound like a deranged Lewis Carroll character or something.

A: You have to remember that I'm not actually human (but rather a magical wizarwhalicorn) so things that might occur to me frequently and seem relatively normal might not be such to yourself, and vice versa.

Fashion is pretty popular right now so here is a fashion post for all you fashion fans. Here are some popular accessories you could enjoy.

Burgers

Here in the U.S. burgers are pretty popular and they seem to be catching on in other places as well. They are very modern and will enhance your "urban chic." People buy them at stores like McDonald's or Wendy's or there is even a shop devoted to them called Burger King. They are not sold online much so you should probably get one at a shop.

Suspenders

Anyone who has been paying attention knows that Larry King is really hot right now and here in this picture he is rocking some suspenders. So these are a hot item and you should probably buy some black ones like he is doing. Sometimes blue could be good too. I see some ones with odd patterns on some kids but I don't think that is really the look right now.

---

use food in danger zone for four hours or less

foods like meat patties and seafood are small enough to go into cooking still frozen; others must be thawed

slow-thawing

place tightly wrapped frozen item, such as roast, on lowest rack of fridge

leave room for air to circulate

may take up to three days depending on size

microwave thawing

thaw food in microwave for immediate cooking only

quick thawing

in a food prep sink, place food in large enough contained and fill with cold, running water for no more than two hours

afterwards, clean and sanitize container, sink, and anything else thawing water may have touched

never thaw foods on counter at room temp.

thermometers should be used to measure:

whether delivery foods are acceptable

internal temps. during cooking--especially with meat

reheating

cooling

foods in hot- and cold-holding

thermometers:

bi-metallic stemmed: probe thermometer; insert lower third of stem into food and read circular gauge at top. should never be left in cooking food. note that this thermometer is slower than probe-type thermometer and report an average range as opposed to an exact one

thermocouple: measures temp. electronically by probe insertion; must be small-tipped

temp. indicator: looks like label on package, contains liquid crystals that change color when food is at unsafe temp.

digital therm.: measures by inserting tip and reading display

food-specific temp.: use only for one kind of food (meat, fried foods, candy, etc.)

equipment therm.: measures temp in ovens, fridges, holding carts and other cooking/storage/serving equip. place fridge therms. in a place where they are easy to read

never use a mercury-based or glass thermometer

thermometers must be calibrated daily and cleaned/sanitized after each use

to calibrate bi-metallic stemmed: place measuring tip in clean container of half-ice, half-slushy water, making sure tip doesn't touch bottom or edge of container

30 seconds after gauge stops moving, turn calibration nut, just below gauge, until needle reads 32 F

method works for thermocouples and digital thermometers as well; if they require adjustment, try replacing battery and otherwise send to authorized repair service

before and after each use, thermometers must be washed, rinsed, air-dried; use food-safe sanitizing solution on the contact areas before putting thermometer away

use temp. log to record:

temp of food

time temp was taken

anything unusual (chilled foods rising above 41 F f'rinstance) (after logging, inform manager)

getting an accurate temperature:

let needle stabilize about fifteen seconds before recording temp.

avoid touching sensor probe against container sides or bottom, which may be warmer than food

foods while cooking: insert sensor into center of food and take measurement in at least two places; make sure thermometer doesn't touch bone

small liquid containers: open one container in batch and insert thermometer; if the contents can't be used immediately, throw away

soft, flexible bulk containers: fold container back on itself with thermometer nested in fold, taking care not to penetrate material

frozen packages: stack two frozen packages with thermometer places in-between

correct cooking times and temps.:

internal temp. must reach these; add 25 F if cooking in microwave

beef roasts: 145 F, 3 min.

 140 F 12 min.

 130 F 121 min.

pork game, minced fish and meats, eggs in large batches:

 155 F 15 sec.

 150 F 1 min.

 145 F 3 min.

ground meat (non-poultry), casseroles with beef:

 155 F 15 sec.

lamb, mutton, veal, fish, seafood, cubed/sliced beef, eggs served promptly, steaks:

 145 F 15 sec.

poultry, stuffed meats, stuffed pasta: 

 165 F 15 sec.

when working with holding stations:

bring food to holding station in covered container

use long-handled utensils to stir/move food

utensils should be kept in food, handle pointing away, when not in use, or else placed in container with drinkable running water

keep containers covered whenever possible; stir food frequently to maintain even temp. and avoid hot or cold spots

measure food temps. by looking at therm. placed in food, not just by reading station's thermostat

note: don't mix new food with old; remove container holding food and replace it with container holding new food

holding cold food

don't let stand at room-temp.; store foods in fridge, display case, ice, or other approved method

always hold cold foods at 41 F; fish, shellfish, poultry, milk, and red meat will stay longer if held at or below 40 F; use metal stem therm. to check food in cold holding

if you use ice to keep food cold on salad bar of display, be sure that ice comes up to level of food in pan or dish; food must be colder than 41 F when put in ice

measure with probe temp at least every four hours

make sure holding unit's light is far enough from food to avoid heating it

hot holding

preheat hot holding stations (steam tables, soup warmers, crock pots, etc.) before placing food

keep hot food at 135 F or higher and measure for temp in more than on enlace using metal-stemmed therm. at least every two hours

after placing on steam table, stir regularly to avoid cold spots

cooling foods

hot foods that can't be served in four hours should be cooled in fridge storage

state law requires that foods be chilled from 135 F to 70 F in two hours and then dropped from 70 F to 41 F in four hours; total of six in "danger zone"

to speed up cooling process:

cut up: cut foods such as meats into smaller portions no larger than four pounds

shallow pans: pour foods into pre-chilled pans to a depth of one inch for soft, thick foods (sauces, stews, etc.) and three inches for thin or liquid foods; place pans in top rack of fridge stirring regularly until chilled to 41 F and then cover

ice water bath: chill pots of hot food by placing pot in a larger container and surrounding pot with ice; stir food frequently so that it chills evenly to 41 F

blast chiller: place pan of food in blast chiller; once food has cooled, move it to a larger, covered storage container

never place a large pot of hot food in the fridge; it will raise the temp. inside the fridge to "danger zone" and the food in the pot will not cool quickly enough allowing bacteria to grow

if food doesn't cool to 41 F in six hours, throw it out

foods that do cool properly should be labeled listing contents and date/time prepared

food cooked and cooled may need to be heated again; when reheating food, do so very quickly (within an hour) to 165 F; right way to do this is on stove burners, in microwave oven, convention oven, or double broiler; don't use anything that will heat food slowly, because it takes too long to pass "danger zone"; stir food to be sure that all parts of it are hot; use metal stem thermometer to check temp.

reheat food only once, using stovetop, grill, or oven--NEVER the hot-holding equipment

reheated food should reach at least 165 F for minimum of 15 sec.

do not mix reheated food with fresh food; if food cannot be reheated in two hours, throw it out

check temp. of reheated food with metal stem therm. before serving

self-service areas:

don't let customers use dirty plates; give them clean plates instead

only re-usable items in self-service are beverage cups

make sure that food guards are in place

immediately replace utensils that have been dropped, touched, or coughed on, and replace any food that has come into contact with those utensils

handling tableware

hold cups by bottom or handle, not rim

hold plates underneath or on edges--not with fingers extending onto rim

hold utensils by handle, not eating end

use a non-breakable utensil with a handle, not a cup or bowl, to scoop ice for water glasses

use tongs to serve finger foods such as breads

do not re-use breads, sauces, and other unwrapped or prepared foods that have been served

any item meant to be thrown away after one use should be stored unopened, off the floor; wash your hands before unwrapping them and avoid touching services that will come into contact with a customer's mouth

---

cleaning removes visible dirt, debris, stains, spills, and other impurities from a surface. use hot water, detergent, scrubbing/wiping implements, and clean water for rinsing.

sanitizing is the process of reducing the number of micro-organisms by using heat or chemicals on a clean surface. dishes and equipment are sanitized.

sanitizing must be a two-step process: surfaces must be cleaned and rinsed, then sanitized

3-sink process:

manual cleaning and sanitizing uses three-basin sink

sink 1: after scraping and pre-rinsing, wash in first sink using hot water and detergent

sink 2: rinse cleaned dishes under clean, hot, running water

sink 3: sanitize dishes using chemical solution of 1 tsp bleach to 1 gallon water (test solution strength w/ test strip), or dip dishes in 170 F water for at least 30 sec.

set items in strainer to air-dry

cleaning equipment:

scrub, rinse, sanitize cutting boards, knives, other utensils after each task

wash, rinse with clear, clean water, sanitize slicers and food processors after each task

electric-powered equipment: unplug first, wash equipment surfaces using soapy water, rinse with clean, clear water, then sanitize with chemical bleach, take out removable parts, cleaning and sanitizing each one before setting aside to air-dry, re-assemble and wash/sanitize surfaces you touch

dishwasher process:

place rinsed, scraped, pre-soaked dishes and utensils in racks so all sides will be cleaned, run machine according to instructions, allow dishes to air-dry

utensils and surfaces that come into contact with raw poultry (knives, cutting boards, etc.) should go through

wiping cloths:

use separate wiping cloths for cleaning surfaces that come into contact with food (equipment, prep tables, cutting boards) and don't contact food (floors, walls, countertops)

each type of cloth is stored in its own bucket with sanitizing solution

wiping cloths in use should be stored in sanitizer between uses

always use a fresh or sanitized cloth for each task

testing sanitizing solutions:

use special test strips to measure the strength of your sanitizing solution

for bleach or chlorine, strip should turn blue; that indicates a 50-100 ppm concentration; less than 50 ppm is too weak while more than 100 ppm is too strong and could cause illness

sanitizing solutions won't adequately kill germs when dirty

cleaning spills:

advise co-workers to prevent them walking through the spill

use a bucket and mop to apply correct cleaning solution; sop up any remaining moisture

post warning signs or cones

put cleaning supplies away properly and wash hands before returning to work

chemical storage

cleansers and other non-food items are always stored separately from foods

chemicals are never stored in food containers or vice-versa

chemicals should be kept in original packaging or break-resistant, clearly labeled containers

follow handling instructions contained in Material Safety Data Sheets

keep chemicals away from food handling areas

store chemicals below and away from food and utensils; farther the better

clean up all chemical spills immediately, then wash hands and if necessary change clothes

garbage storage

don't "store" garbage--move promptly out of food handling area to waste container outside

make sure that doors and windows keep out pests; also store garbage carefully to not attract them. don't allow food or other waste to gather in food areas; keep storage area clean; arrange for garbage to be removed regularly.

proper disposal of garbage:

place garbage in sturdy, leak-proof containers with tight-fitting lids

containers should be lined with clear plastic bags or wet-strength paper

clean and sanitize containers frequently to prevent odor and pests

always wash hands

breakdowns, outages, and facility emergencies

fridge is out: measure food temps. with metal stem therm.; if 41 F or colder, move immediately to other fridge if available; if not, keep door shut. when power returns, measure again; throw out foods in "danger zone"

stove/oven stops working: use approved methods to cool food that was cooking and fridge; if cooked food in broken hot holding station falls below 140 F, throw out

hot water is off: can't sanitize; stop food service immediately

major service interruptions: water/sewer/power/heating/etc.--best course is to close restaurant until services are restored

call in sick if you have:

fever/chills

vomiting or nausea

diarrhea

jaundice

heavy coughing and sneezing or runny nose

sore throat with fever

eye discharge

an infected cut or burn

open wounds or boils

food borne diseases

the "big five":

salmonella typhi

shigella

e coli O157:H7

hepatitis A

norovirus

salmnoella

symptoms: nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhea, fever, headache, loss of appetite 6-48 hours after eating food 1-2 days or longer

found in raw meat, raw and undercooked poultry/eggs, unpasteurized milk and dairy, feces of vectors

high risk--food service worker living in same house as person with salmonella could contract through fecal-hand-oral route w/out proper hygiene

people of all ages can be affected but worst for infants, elderly, immune compromised

important to cook food to proper temps and times as bacteria is heat-resistant

use clean equip. and proper sanitation to avoid cross-contamination, wash hands, etc.

shigella

symptoms: bloody diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting, cramps 12-50 hours after eating

found in salads, tuna, macaroni, potato, chicken, raw veggies, milk, poultry, transmitted via fecal-hand-oral

food service worker in same house as infected person at high risk if not sanitary

symptoms worst for infants, elderly, immune-comrpomised

transmitted through ready-to-eat foods

excellent hygiene, proper storage, thorough cooking will prevent

e coli

attacks intestinal lining causes cramping abdominal pain watery diarrhea vomiting low-grade fever lasts for 8 days some people esp. young children may develop hemolytic uremic syndrome which may lead to kidney failure

found in undercooked/raw hamburger meat esp. as well as unpasteurized milk/apple juice, fresh fruits, alfalfa, radish sprouts

food service living in same house at risk

most severe for normal groups

can be prevented by proper handling and cooking (155 F) of beef--monitor grill temps with probe therm. serve only pasteurized milk and juice

wash hands, don't work if sick

hep. a

fever nausea abdom. pain followed by jaundice

fecal-oral most often found in cold cuts, salads, fruits, juices, milk, other dairy, shellfish, iced drinks

food service in same house

more common in adults than children but everyone who ingests virus and can't fight it off is susceptible to infection

hep. a transmitted through ready-to-eat foods w/out proper hygiene

avoid eating raw shellfish sharing drinks, kissing, hugging, casual contact does not spread virus stay home from work if sick

norovirus

member of calicivirus group, also known as "Norwalk-like viruses" also called gastroenteritis, food poisoning, calicivirus

causes gastroenteritis, an inflammation of stomach, small and large intestines. leading cause of foodborne illness often referred to as "stomach flu" but is not a flu (flu is a respiratory illness)

symptoms include nausea vomiting diarrhea abdom. cramps, may include headache, fever/chills, muscle aches usually last 1-2 days but during that period infected may feel very ill and vomit frequently

virus found in stool and vomit of those infected, can be spread by eating food/drink infected via inadequate hand washing, eating before washing hands, having close contact with an infected person; can spread rapidly through day-care centers, nursing homes, etc.

an employee diagnosed with one of the "big five" MUST stay home and manager must contact local health authority

if employee has symptoms of foodborne illness (vomiting, diarrhea, and/or fever), infected sore (lesion w/ pus) on hand or arm, persistent discharge from eyes, nose, or mouth (coughing, runny nose, sneezing) must be restricted from duties

burns

can be caused by heat or chemicals; immediately place burned part in cold water and contact doctor

proper procedures to prevent:

hot oil in deep fryers:  cool oil to 100 F before disposing, don't use plastic containers unless oil is completely cool, don't drop food into hot oil (use tongs/frying basket)

hot liquids/foods: don't place just-washed food into oil as water will cause oil to sputter risking burns or fire, don't use deep fryer to heat food containers, use hot pads/padded mitts when handling hot pots and pans, use dry hot pads/padded mits when handling pots/pans containing hot liquid/food; wet pads can get hot quickly and burn, wear right clothing (shirt covering neck and arms down to wrists, close-toed shoes), remove plastic gloves before handling hot pots/pans as plastic can melt and burn severely

steam: stay away from pot when removing lit from steam kettle, stand to one side and turn face away when removing pans from steam table, lids should be removed slowly so steam can escape from back of lid while you use lid as face shield, never open a pressure cooker unless pressure is zero

chemical burns: use chemicals as directed on label, ask supervisor if unsure, never mix chemicals, be sure that spray bottles for cleaners/sanitizers are plainly labeled and stored away from food prep, destroy used chemical containers so they are not used for food storage accidentally, use plastic gloves when handling undiluted sanitizers/cleaners

cuts

knives: sharpen knives frequently, use knives only for intended purpose, store knives away from other utensils and never leave in sink or wastewater, wear mesh gloves when cleaning knives and slicer blades

power-driven cutting equipment: slicers, mixers, etc. can cause serious cuts or loss of fingers; use clean sanitized mesh gloves, don't operate if you are under 18 and it is against the law to do so, sharpen equip. regularly, don't remove guards and safety switches

glass: don't put dishes to be hand washed all in sink at once, as heaver dishes can crush lighter ones leading to cuts, don't stack glasses and cups inside each other as they can stick together and break, never use a glass or dish to scoop ice or ice cream as they can chip, use a separate and clearly-labeled garbage for broken glass/dishes

floor hazards

keep mats well tacked-down and ensure edges are tapered, keep floors clean and dry, don't hurry while carrying heavy loads, wear shoes with non-slip soles

supply storage

use good step ladder to reach supplies stored above head

sprains/strains

most caused by lifting improperly, can cause permanent injury; never store heavy items higher than waist level, keep back straight and use legs for power, be sure footing is solid, get load as close to body as possible, don't reach out and lift, avoid loose/flapping clothing so it does not catch on anything, be sure that shoe laces are tied, check if handles are secure, load is balanced, not slippery, no sharp edges/protruding nails, nothing loose that will shift; if load is too heavy, seek help

first aid for choking

ask "are you choking" shout HELP!

call for help if victim can't cough/speak/breathe, is coughing weakly, is making high-pitched noises. phone 9-1-1 send someone to call ambulance

do abdominal thrusts: wrap arms around waist, make fist, don't bear hug (hold arms away from victim), place thumb-side of fist just above navel and well below lower tip of breastbone, grasp fist w/ other hand, press fist into abdomen quickly upward, repeat thrusts until object is coughed up or victim starts to breathe/cough, lower victim to floor if unconscious, perform finger sweep by grasping tongue and lower jaw, lift jaw, slide finger down inside cheek and base of tongue, sweep object out, open airway by tilting head back, lifting chin, giving two full breaths, keeping head tilted back, pinching nose shut, seal lips tightly around victim's mouth, give two full breaths for 1 to 1.5 secs. each, give 6-10 abdominal thrusts if air won't go in by placing heel of one hand against middle of victim's abdomen, placing other hand on top of first hand, and pressing into abdomen w/ quick upward thrusts, repeat until airway is clear or ambulance arrives

inform supervisor if injured; if you are infected you can be temporarily re-assigned to other work that doesn't involve handling food; can tell if injury is infected because it'll be inflamed, red around wound, and/or pus-ridden; don't handle food if you have an infected cut/burn/sore; if injury isn't infected and you are cleared for food handling, wash hands, keep injury clean and bandaged, wear gloves or other covering over

bioterrorism: use of bio. agents to spread illness and fear

bioterror is rare, but a possibility and has happened

prevent health threats before they occur through safety, security, hiring practices, and careful food handling

agents

physical, chemical, and biological methods

physical: any material can cause phys. damage

chemical: usually delivered as droplets, liquids, solids

biological: usually as loiuids/aerosols/solids: including bacteria, viruses, parasites

you can:

review all business procedures, phys. facilities, and shipping/distr. systems

ensure that facility has adequate security measures: restricted access, esp. ingredient, product, chem. storage areas, plus checking all restrooms/closets for suspicious activities, train all employees well

store all hazerdous chemicals and pesticide away from storage and display areas, have safety sheets

ensure that compos. and integrity of all materials are safe and sound: know supply source well and make your restrictions clear, inspect all incoming materials for tampering and sups. activity, compare delivery slips with original request, make sure you can trace back all materials to supplier

create an emergency response team and create action plan w/ 24-hour contact info for suppliers: test plan and make sure all employ. know

keep written record of items returned to store for refund and don't store w/ other items

if you expect sab. or bioterror call 9-1-1 and call local police, and don't touch product or exposed equipment, restricting access and following exposure guidelines if necessary

gabi's hatred of "gay shit" is directly connected with her fear of weakness; "gayness" is in a manner of speaking an admission that one is unable to "buck up" and make themselves function normally and thus is an unacceptable concession; furthermore, in a larger sense, "gayness" glorifies a certain kind of "weakness"/emotional vulnerability/etc. that triggers gabi's fear response in that situation

Gender: An Extended Metaphor

People have been talking a lot in the past century or so about what gender exactly is. I think gender is an art medium, like literature or sculpture. Like any art medium, it is similar to the others but different in key ways. Gender is different in ways that make it the worst art medium ever. You may not necessarily feel this way right now--you may be pretty happy with your body of work--but I think it's definitely true regardless of who you are. I've set up the following metaphor to illustrate why:

Imagine that you suddenly end up in an unfortunate alternate dimension. You know nothing about this dimension to start off with, but you pretty quickly realize that everyone in this dimension appears to be playing in a jam band together (drat). It's a pretty limited band in some ways. At first glance, everyone appears to be playing one of roughly two kinds of instruments, and indeed most people in the band will tell you that it only has two instruments, violins and cellos. When you enter this dimension, you are given one of these instruments, and told very quickly that it is either that it is a violin or a cello, before you have really had any time to figure out what that means or even what the hell is going on at all. As it turns out, there are two different sets of established techniques for the two different instruments, and right away, slapdash, while you are still reeling and just trying to figure out how you got into this dimension, the people who told you what instrument you have start teaching you how to play it, based on what they've been taught by or picked up from other people in the band. At first you have little idea what to do with all this--everything in this dimension just seems completely weird ("Why is everyone playing in a jam band, and with just string instruments? What on Earth?" you may ask, which you will learn much later is a heavy academic sort of question)--but pretty quickly you start picking up the basics and can play some rudimentary music. This is nice, in theory, because in this dimension playing music with others is one of the most fundamental forms of communication (it is a jam band, after all) and people have a difficult time listening to what you're saying unless you're play some music with them, particularly in a style they know how to play with.

At first, it might just seem like you need to figure out how to play with the people near to you, but eventually you discover that the stakes are much higher. A lot of people in this dimension are really attached to the gigantic band playing a certain style of music as a whole, and they expect everyone with a violin to be playing certain kinds of violin music and everyone with a cello to be playing certain kinds of cello music so that this style can be produced. A fair number of other people are more democratic; they think that everyone with a cello should get to play whatever kind of cello music they want and everyone with a violin should get to play whatever kinds of violin music they want, more or less. This is often because they realize that they've grown attached to the style of music they're playing and really wouldn't like it if someone tried to get them to play differently, even if that is unlikely to happen because they're playing a popular style, so they don't want to do that to other people. In any case, these camps combined constitute most of the band, and people within them tend often to not even have thought about the fact that they are playing in a band at all (since that's what you do in this dimension, and they've been doing it forever), and usually feel pretty good about it on the whole if they have. Usually, when they have thought about it, they have thought about how there are people with violins, and people with cellos, and they are playing together, and they've used most of their further thoughts on this to flesh out the specifics of that concept.

However, there are some people who don't fall into either of these camps, and these people are often in a certain kind of trouble. This is because they want to play their instruments differently from how they were taught, and how everyone around them resultantly expects them to play, and this bothers most of the other people in the band greatly because they see those sorts of actions as messing up the music they are trying really hard to make with a bunch of the rest of the band. To a lot of the other people in the band, playing an instrument that way sounds really dissonant and jarring against the music most of everyone else is trying to play, which in the minds of most of the music-makers musses the music for most everyone. 

A small number of people manage to find amplifiers and make their instruments especially loud, so that a lot of people in the band will hear them better than most of everyone else, except the other people sitting really near them. 

critical reading guide to geneva's business cards:

the name came from geneva's inquiry into the spanish word for beans and the last name of a puritan in early america; it was her idea

the profession was mine, after she said she wanted a name that sounded legit on the surface but made no sense after closer consideration

1908 is the year the bush beans company was founded

shimmystature is a similarly alliterative synonym for wigglesworth

funnelsburg, similarly, was chosen for the synonymous relationship between the funnel and the syphon

AS is the state abbreviation for american samoa, but could also be an abbreviation for analyst

25151 is obtained by taking each letter in the word "beans" and adding together the digits of its place in the alphabet until a number from 1-9 is reached

man loses himself in love for another; feels he completely drowns, falls in a pit, dissolves in the face of the other man

1st project--statue placement in breakroom; after analysis of breakroom movement, places statue in least-frequented area; one person, an outlier who did stand there regularly, now follows the pattern of the others; another, who did not stand there but walked in an unusual pattern around the breakroom, now also follows the pattern established ("ordinarily I would not put a statue in a breakroom in which all the walls are lined with counters and cabinets, but I think it will be an interesting exercise for you and a testament to the ingeniousness of our company as a whole")

software & hardware package tested and ready; ideology of map controls territory sees first application, although it is not clear in that form yet

2nd--East Austin: building an indoor basketball court on an empty lot; picking from two lots; analysis to determine which lot is more frequented; purpose of initiative to reduce crime; after installation of court, it becomes highly attended, while people in less frequented lot stop going there to visit the court; analysis fulfilled

monitoring equipment installed to study movement patterns and land use in the east austin neighborhood; a few people hired to work under jack at his request; seth hints at ideology

3rd--maximize efficiency of pedestrian movement on a vital business intersection; idea being that quicker movement will lead to better business (faster, less aggravated, etc.) and thus spur economy if conducted on a wide scale; first project a test-run; after modifications are made, people follow the routes set out for them that they were pigeonholed into by the analysis

project applied on wide scale; monitoring equipment installed on all busy intersections, then all commonly frequented intersections, etc. to analyze them and improve them for efficiency of use; also begins to be applied to vehicle traffic(maybe?); gov. absorbs company; jack begins to command a battery of employees; seth discusses ideology in more depth

4th--inspired by ped. efficiency, gov. decides to use sophia to improve the efficiency of a government building; not just pedestrian movement but technology use, paper trails, meeting spaces, and so on are analyzed; after all modifications are made and each employee is given a copy of pertinent parts of the map to carry and utilize on their handhelds--which, due to the design of the building, it becomes necessary to do in order to move around the building and accomplish tasks with any kind of quickness (the "officially efficient" way becomes the only efficient way after the re-design)--the building perfectly matches the map

seth begins to fully reveal depths of ideology to jack; just as sophia begins truly to ascend to power with the government choosing to utilize their techniques citywide, jack becomes deeply disturbed; he flees to Ireland and uses his expertise to create and run a sustainable farm with an ideology gleaned from a different sort of analysis; afterwards seth becomes mayor and austin is eventually dominated by sophia's tech., which now runs every aspect of the city and has begun to spread outwards and attach itself to other cities, which find the ideology attractive; jack has run as far from it as he can; receives a letter from seth detailing what's been done; seth is a cartographer to the end; finished with Leonard Cohen line, "you're living for nothing now. I hope you're keeping some kind of record..."

The mistake people make when they see the existence of God or a set of gods is going *up* instead of *down*.

Okay, I promise I'm not Orz, I promise, but I'm not sure what else to do with those words. I don't really mean up, I mean *up*.

HIDEOUS MISTAKE LOG

0. Spending (close to?) $300 shipping my drum kit without allowing myself a lot of financial padding for fuck-ups. (risky thing to do, but might not turn out to be a mistake at all; however, might)

1. Waiting until Friday night to finish my work off and pack and staying up 'till 5:30 AM to do one and start the other, resulting in 4 hours of pseudo-sleep, kinda, and making me hella incompetent all day. Thinking that because it was the last day and I didn't have class, incompetence wouldn't matter. (major mistake)

2. Sleeping in by hitting "snooze" every ten minutes (so not getting real sleep) 'till 9:30 instead of waking up at 7:30 as I had planned (not really possible to prevent given how tired I was, but did not help me at all; if I had started packing at 7:30 I might've made the shuttle). (minor mistake)

3. Hanging around after commencement. (very minor mistake--only cost me about twenty minutes)

4. As a result of everything else, not finishing packing until 3:30 and missing the shuttle. Freaking out and not keeping my head level. (major locus-type mistake)

5. Calling a cab before I was ready to go, then rushing to leave and 

not double-checking my itinerary

. (WORST MISTAKE)

6. Not thinking that I could possibly be wrong about the flight leaving from Hartford until the driver mentioned it when we were out of cell phone service and remained so for about forty minutes before I could call anyone. (medium mistake--would not have saved me my flight but would have some money)

It is the most hideous thing that we are alive, but it is the luckiest thing for us, too!

ask Carl about transference; is it when a psychologist utilizes experiences in their own life to analyze a patient, or does it have to do with a kind of projection in which the psychologist "transfers" their conflicts directly into the therapeutic process?

also discuss artistic anxiety; the presence of a figure so intimidating as Joanna Newsom--and especially one so similar to you in position, in that she is quite young, walks between pop and art spheres, and studied music in college--makes it difficult for me to feel able to create in the same sphere as her, because I think she is the best songwriter alive and that makes it difficult for me to do something similar to her without (a) aping her (which I don't want to do; after all, we are different people) and (b) avoiding her sphere entirely, or intentionally creating music that sounds nothing like hers (which I also don't want to do, because our artistic goals seem to be so similar).

Looking at this Urban Dictionary entry on "at the end of the day," I see that a lot of people have negative feelings about people using common idioms in speech. Now, I recognize that it is good to strive for originality when talking and all that but at the end of the goddamn day idioms serve an important role in language.

 Karl turned off the lights.

 In an alternate universe, I am Debbie Harrie. I walk down the sidewalk in shining black heels and count every flower out loud. I can smell every bumblebee in town. They smell like flour, soaked in lavender. I feel dizzy, like on a tilt-a-wheel.

 My boyfriend's name is Carlo. He likes to imagine that he is Puerto Rican, but is he from Wyoming, where there are no Puerto Ricans. He has perfectly smooth hands, and when I stare into his palms, I see nautilus fractals, twisting down forever into empty space. He strokes my blonde hair, and I get goosebumps all down back of my neck. I like to imagine that we will get married, on a perfectly white yacht, so white that it will blind the beachgoers.

 I like to eat creampuffs, on high landings, and I spit when I think Carlo isn't watching. I lick my fingernails, but I don't bite them. I have a kitten that I carry in my purse. I whisper to snails and they lap at my ankles, and I while away the late mornings casually perfecting bouquets, all over all the windowsills of my shining house.

 In this alternate universe, I am twenty-two forever. Carlo and I lay cuddling naked in our bed under a bright window, three stories high in Paris. It's soft, and warm.

Louisiana Clover /or/ Tripoli (?)

1 tsp-tblsp. honey, depending on yer sweetness/hotness preferences

4-5 drops Peychaud's

3-4 drops malt vinger

small splash of vanilla

splash of water

a shot of unaged rye

a sprig of sage

Add honey, Peychaud's, vinegar, and water to a chilled glass. muddle until all ingredients are combined. Pour the shot on, garnish with sage, and have two people near you play one single note on a banjo and a bowed viola over and over very slowly until a few minutes after you finish. Sip with touching slowness--aim to move those around to silent tears through the art of your drinking manner.

 It was miserably/wonderfully late outside, but inside there was no time at all. I lay on the floor and longed to smoke a cigarette indoors, while Karl puttered around the kitchen trying to find ingredients for his new cocktail. "It's really a shame, though," he was saying, "because we don't know anyone with a viola."

 "I think Olivia has a viola," I said from the floor.

 "She just has a cello." He accidentally knocked a bottle of cooking Cabernet out of the cupboard but kept going as if nothing had happened.

 "Does it really have to be a viola?"

 "I just--I think a cello would be too grave, y'know? Like, way, way too sombre. This is sort of lighthearted. Think, like, Terry Riley."

 "Ooookaaaay," I said, and sighed, and rolled over. I began to closely study the outlet on the wall--the lines on each plug squiggled as if they were pinned inchworms. When I moved my head closer the whole outlet dissolved into flashing black and white paisley. It made me shiver and wriggle with delight, and I closed my eyes. Karl's face appeared, grinning cartoonishly, but his face instantly became a bear's face, and the bear's eyes sparkled with rainbows like an oil slick, and the bear opened his mouth and split into two wholes facing in opposite directions, and his two stuck-out tongues splashed out of his mouthes made of red liquid--I opened my eyes, because it became too much.

 "How are you doing?" said Karl.

 "Mmmmmmm," I said, twisting my head just enough to face him a little bit. "Uhh." His head was surrounded by small points of light and looked extremely far away, and I was so distracted that I couldn't say anything.

 "That--sounds nice," he said.

 "Is this really, like&Do you really not--what's going on, for you?"

 "I'm trying to make a cocktail."

 "Hasn't it been like ten minutes?"

 "Ummm," he said, and checked the clock on the microwave. "It's been four."

 "Weird," I said, and turned to look at the outlet again. It was still a bunch of monochrome paisley, but it wasn't doing it for me like it did before. I stood up and walked over to the kitchen. Karl was staring into the stove, and I huddled up next to him, putting my hand in the small of his back, and looked over his shoulder.

 Without saying anything, he turned on one of the stove burners. The fire burned so brightly that everything around it seemed very dark. I leaned as close to it as I could without burning my nose and watched the quivering bright blue line running through the middle of the flames. In the fire, I saw the same patterns I'd seen in glittery nebulae every time I'd seen one on a poster or they'd shown them on TV. I thought about how much larger those nebulae were than the fire on the stove was, and I felt a pang in my stomach, and my eyes watered, and a minute later I felt one tear run down my cheek and into the corner of my mouth.

 When we went to bed that night, Karl and I lay together, my head on his chest, not moving or speaking or sleeping, for a very long time. Our touching skin felt like shifting clay, and I could not tell where the borders between us were at all. It seemed that we grew out of each other, or were one twisting, writhing, severely alive animal. I knew he felt the same thing, and I wanted to actually cry, but I was too far away.

 The next afternoon we had a late brunch with [Ganesh].

 "Did you guys have a good night?" he asked, over a tablecloth covered in dancing cowboys.

 "Oh, yeah," I said. "It was incredible."

 "Yeah," said Karl, nodding. "It was really good. I like that stuff a lot."

 "Great, I'm glad to hear it," said Ganesh, and smiled.

 "I didn't really get much in the way of visuals, but, you know, I felt like it made me think really well." He laughed. "I spent like two hours in the kitchen or something." Our waittress, a wiry old woman with her hair up and a cat necklace, came by with our water and left immediately without saying anything. Karl drank half his glass right away and then turned to face me. "You seemed like you were having a pretty crazy time, though," he said.

 "It was pretty strange," I said to Ganesh. "I just saw, like, all these patterns everywhere. If I looked closely enough at something, it would just dissolve."

 "Yeah, that happens," said Ganesh.

 "I drew a lot," I said. I reached into one of my skirt pockets and pulled out a piece of paper, unfolding it for Ganesh to see, and handed it to him.

 In the middle of the page was a circle with three spheres inside of it. Tendrils snaked out from it in all directions, twisting themselves into smaller circles with smaller spheres in them, which spawned their own tendrils, with their own circles--on and on, filling all the space, off towards edges of the page and as far down as the eye could make out. But around the borders of the page, the tendrils squirmed into the heads of a bunch of different breeds of dog.

 "This is awesome," said Ganesh. "This is really cool." He looked at it for a few more seconds. "How long did this take you?"

 "I don't know," I said, shaking my head. "Maybe an hour or two?"

 "Nah," said Karl. "An hour tops. You totally lost your conception of time."

 "Not totally," I said. "I could sort of guess what time it was. An hour's not that far off."

 "Yeah, I guess that's sort of true," he said, with a grin.

 "Oh come on," I said, laughing, and elbowed him in the side. He shoved me towards the wall, but Ganesh handed the drawing back before we could get further into it, and I folded it up and put it away.

 Our waittress came by again. "Y'all look like you're having fun," she said, surprisingly genial in light of her earlier silence. We all smiled, genuinely. "Have y'all heard about Zombie Booth?" she said.

 "What?" said Karl.

 "Zombie Booth! It's this new thing you can get on your phone! You just take a picture of someone--and it turns them into a zombie!"

 "Wow," said Karl.

 "It's too good! You can do it on the internet, too. You just upload a photo, and wham! They're a zombie!" She snapped her fingers.

 "Sounds pretty cool," said Karl.

 "So what can I get for y'all today?" she said.

 s

 "Well, it sounds like you guys had a good time," he said.

 "Oh my god, yeah," I said, "It really was one of the best nights of my life."

 "That's awesome," he said, and smiled.

 "There was this moment," I said, turning to Karl,"when you turned on the stove--"

 "Oh, man, yeah, that was incredible, I'm really glad I decided to do that," he said.

 "When I looked at it, I saw nebulas. Like, bright blue nebulas. It just seems so crazy that something so big and something so small could be so similar."

 "Cool," said [Ganesh]. "Yeah, stuff like that is really awesome."

 I took another sip of my coffee. I was on my third, and beginning to feel it in my legs, which were bouncing uncontrollably. The coffee had become lukewarm--I had become so focused on the conversation that I'd forgotten about it for a while. I nibbled at the remains of my hash. Karl picked up a slice of cantaloupe and deftly popped it into his mouth, chewing methodically, staring at nothing.

 "Do y'all wanna go for a walk?" said Karl, still half in his reverie.

 "Um, is it cool if I finish eating?" said [Ganesh], who still had half a pancake left.

 "Oh, yeah, sorry," said Karl.

 Ganesh instantly tucked into his pancake and left the rest of the world alone. I turned to Karl.

 "I really would like to do that again," I said. "I mean, sometime."

 "Well, we can," said Karl. "I wouldn't really want to right away, but, you know, I'm always down to trip if you feel like it." He took a sip of my coffee. "Ugh, man, this stuff is cold."

 "Sorry," I said. "I haven't been drinking it very quickly."

 "Yeah," he said. "But, yeah, you know, just let me know whenever you feel like it."

 [Ganesh] finished his pancake. Karl stood up, and we followed suit, striding with purpose after him out of the diner. It was a crisp afternoon--the air smelled wonderfully clean, like water from a stone spring, and the wind deftly rustled the just-orange leaves of the trees lining the sidewalk. We walked as if we were going somewhere in particular--Karl and [Ganesh] didn't even look at all the people we passed, or any of the buildings, and just kept their eyes straight ahead, fixed on an imaginary destination. I followed a few feet behind and glanced at the face of every stranger I could get away with. There was an old man with tight Scottish features and a full head of short grey hair out walking a huge bounding wolfhound the exact same color, and I made eye contact with him on accident, but he smiled at me, and I waved, and afterwards I almost wanted to cheer.

 Karl turned his head around to face me. "Do you wanna go to a bookstore?"

 "Sure," I shouted. I would rather have gone somewhere where we could keep talking, but that sounded nice too.

 Karl and [Ganesh] spoke for a moment, and then Karl turned back at me again. "There's one like four blocks away that Ganesh wants to show us."

 "Yeah, let's go," I said.

 Karl had been doing tensor calculus, but got distracted explaining spinners to me.

 "A spinner," he had been saying, "is a mathematical object that points in a direction, and when you spin it 360 degrees, it points in a different direction. So think of a clock--imagine one of the hands pointing at the stroke of twelve, and then you hit it and it spins around 360 degrees back to twelve again, and then you hit it to spin it that much again and it ends up pointing in the opposite direction, at six, even though you spun it the same way."

 "That's so weird," I said. "Like, really, really weird--why do they do that?"

 "Ummm," said Karl. "That's just what they do. They're defined by that property--a spinner is something that behaves that way."

 "But why?" I said. "There just has to be a reason. Like, you could compare spinners to other things that you can 'spin"--like, whatever the action is that we've decided to call 'spinning'--and see how those things behave, and compare them to how spinners behave, and in studying like 'spin dynamics' or whatever you would come up with an answer."

 "I dunno," said Ganesh, chiming in. "Some things just work the way they work. I mean like why is a table a table? A table is just a table because we call it a table, you know?"

 "Okay, but," I said. "A table is something we eat off, or work at, or put things on. It's a piece of furniture. It sits in the middle of your house. It's big, several people can sit at it. It's a surface with legs. I mean, you know--how can you tell a table's not, like, an airplane?"

 "But sometimes things are the way they are just because that's how they are, y'know? Not everything has to be for a reason. We just sort of invent reasons for things, you know, a lot of the time."

 "But--well not really--" I said, but then Karl spoke up from behind his phone.

 "So there is a reason why spinners behave the way they do," he said. We both turned to listen to him. "It's because they're a member of the representation of the Clifford algebra."

 "Do you know about the Clifford algebra?" I said.

 "I know how it's defined," said Karl.

 "How?"

 "The Clifford algebra is defined by the commutative bracket," said Karl.

Initial thoughts:

mozart's piece not always true cnpt.; oftentimes one instrument plays chords while the other carries the melody, though the two do trade dominance in the manner of contrapuntal voices

josquin's piece, being choral and far less energetic than mozart's or bach's, has a very different feel from the either two; also, it constitutes true four-voice choral counterpoint, but distributes rhythmic energy throughout the four voices, so that either one, taken on its own, would not function nearly as well, though would still be melodically viable

bach's fugue is remarkably energetic and the best example here of traditional counterpoint; both voices function as highly forceful and intriguing melodies alone and function perfectly in tandem. each voice exchanges subjective and motivic content and will typically play role of subject (or subjective material carrier) and countersubject (or countersubjective material carrier), exchanging dominance dynamically and often throughout the piece.

Kafka's Split Heart: The Trial as Gnostic Parable

        

The Trial is marked by intense numinousness. The overarching presence of the court, as an omnipresent, incomprehensible, and terrifying force that consumes Josef K. until it kills him and keeps him forever from redemption, invokes a remarkable religious dread that likens the text to a parable. In fact, Kafka's own spiritual sensibilities and relationship with creativity created in him a dread akin to that evoked by the court of the text and ultimately fearful of the fate, in metaphoric terms, that befalls Josef K, embodying a death of creative opportunity in the shadow of mundane familial and societal obligations in a manner which for Kafka had a distinctly spiritual and even markedly Gnostic quality. Ulimately, The Trial functions as an existential, secular, Gnostic parable of the modern age that evokes in metaphorical terms a fear of earthly consumption Kafka himself bore.

        

The court of The Trial evokes a religious dread akin to Rudolph Ottos concept of mysterium tremendum as put forth in Das Heilige. This concept is characterized both by a daemonic&uncanny fear carrying with it an absolute overpoweringness that induces a humbling creature-feeling of ultimate inferiority in the receiver and a sense of the numinous force as wholly other, transcendent, and beyond the receiver of it (Otto, 13-28). Such things are said of the court. The court is everywhere and consumes all; it is stated directly that everything belongs to the court and indeed it is shown to be entirely without bounds (Kafka, 150). Furthermore, it possess a fierce and unstoppable wrath; it is a bureaucracy that is always vengeful but in an undisturbable state of eternal equilibrium, and if one disturbs it one will only ruin oneself as it will destroy one but itself cannot be changed (Kafka, 119-120). In this manner, it possesses Ottos absolute overpoweringness in full. To make matters worse, its wrath is completely arbitrary and defies logical apprehension, as the opinions of court officials are easily swayed by the slightest provocation and furthermore liable to issue decisions that convey the exact opposite of their professed opinion, thus making the courts wrath impossible to interface with on rational terms and placing one constantly in fear of attracting its literally deadly contempt which as far as one knows could happen at any time. This mirrors exactly Ottos conception of numinous wrath with regards to the concept of mysterium tremendum; he writes that the reason such a force inspires such dread is because its magnitude is entirely beyond man and it possess a wrathful potential that has no concern whatever with moral qualities&[instead it is] like stored up electricity, discharging itself upon anyone who comes too near. It is incalculable and arbitrary, using Yahwehs wrath in the Old Testament as an example. Given this, the court seems to be mysterium tremendum incarnate.

        

However, the court is not the only omnipresent entity in the text; we also encounter the Law, which the court is supposedly beholden to and exists to uphold, but in fact functions as a barrier to. The Law, when taken separately from the court, epitomizes the other aspect of numinous experience, namely that of the fascinans or element of fascination. Otto writes of this aspect, the ideas and concepts which are the parallels&on the rational side of this non-rational element of fascination are love, mercy, pity, comfort; these are all natural elements of the common psychical life, only they are here thought as absolute and in completeness (Otto, 31). Fascinans is essentially the concept of redemptive religious bliss. The Law has such a transcendental and redemptive character throughout the text, as well as a sometimes overtly religious one, likening it in some ways to the court and setting it completely at odds with it in others; for instance, the painter tells Josef K. that the Law, which [hes] never read&says of course on the one hand an innocent person is to be acquitted; on the other hand it does not say that judges can be influenced, but his experience has been precisely the opposite, and goes on to say that he has never seen a person acquitted and the influence of judges by outside sources is universal in the trials he has witnessed (Kafka, 153). However, he has only witnessed trials in the lower courts, which do not have the ability to grant final acquittals; that power resides only in the highest court, which is totally inaccessible, the painter tells Josef K., to you and me and everyone else. We dont know what things look like up there, and incidentally, we dont want to know (Kafka, 158). This motif of a higher court far in the stratosphere that is free from everything that problematizes the lower court Josef K. is being tried under is repeated continually; Block, the merchant, even tells Josef K. of the great lawyers, [who]&stand incomparably higher in rank above the petty lawyers than those do over the despised shysters, but who are impossible to contact and only take on cases that have already advanced beyond the lower court (Kafka, 179). This higher court appears to present the only path for truly escaping a trial, as it upholds the Law and can grant true acquittals, but the lower court actually functions in opposition to it, and no one in the lower court has ever seen the higher court or evens knows it exists beyond hearsay; in fact, the barrier between the lower court and the higher court, and thus the lower court and the Law, seems impenetrable even in perceptual terms.

        

This relationship is epitomized in the parable of the gatekeeper presented by the prison chaplain, who functions as the closest thing to a bridge between the lower court and the Law possible given their separation; his parable comes from the introductory texts to the Law, indicating that though he has not necessarily read the Law itself he has come closer than anyone else Josef K. encounters, and furthermore Josef K. even gets the sense from him that he might reveal not how to influence the trial, as everyone else does, but how to break out of it&even though he himself [is] part of the court. This is the possibility that the Law itself presents, and though it is not possible for the chaplain to do this given his place in the court his illustration of the way the court functions in relation to the Law is the closest thing Josef K. gets. In the chaplains parable, a man from the country, drawn irresistibly to the Law, attempts to enter and despite being told he cannot at the moment, although it is possible, waits and attempts to enter for the entire rest of his life; this further adds to the conception of the Law as fascinans, as Otto characterizes the object of religious fascination as [alluring] with a potent charm, and the individual has always&the impulse to turn to it (Kafka, 215; Otto, 31). The doorkeeper, though he never forcefully prevents the man from entering, forbids him from doing so and informs him that he, the doorkeeper, is powerful&and [is] only the lowest doorkeeper, telling him of a succession of ever-more powerful doorkeepers that lie in the interior, and the man, intimated by this information and the imposing sight of the doorkeeper, chooses to wait for admittance, which he of course never receives; essentially, he is kept from the Law by the sheer presence of the doorkeeper alone, as he feels compelled to obey the doorkeeper given his apparently unimpeachable power (Kafka, 217-218). Additionally, the chaplain points out to Josef K. that the doorkeeper does not know the interior of the Law, and in fact fears the Law more than the man seeking entrance, as the man wants nothing more than to enter, even after hes been told about the terrifying doorkeepers within, while the doorkeeper has no wish to enter. Furthermore, he cannot have been far into the interior, given that just the third doorkeeper is too much for him to bear (Kafka, 220). It is acknowledged, too, that the doorkeeper cannot shut the gate to the Law as he claims, because the gate to the Law always stands open, and thus he cannot truly prevent entrance to it but only serve as a sort of potent psychological barrier (Kafka, 221-222). Finally, the circumstances of the mans death are worth special attention, as, with the Law as a redemptive numinous force, the man sees his own salvation at the time of his death, though he remains outside the Law; the doorkeeper is unable to see it at all, however, as he is facing the other direction and does not notice the radiance, maintaining as always the strict separation between him, i.e. the court, and the true Law (Kafka, 222). This notably mirrors the circumstances of Josef K.s death, in which he sees a window open like a light flickering on, and a faint human figure appears with arms outstretched that Josef K. immediately signifies as representing, if anything, a friend, a good person, or someone who [cares], and leads him directly to wonder where the judge hed never seen and the high court hed never reached was, immediately before he is killed; this person is thus analogically representative of the Law and its redemptive potential, a position even signified by its visual imagery of being a figure high and removed from the world at large, and Josef K., desirous of reaching it, stretches his hands out to it in the same manner, and it is at this precise moment when he is cut through (Kafka, 230-231).

        

Fittingly, this entire set of circumstances maps, metaphorically, directly onto Kafka's own conception of the relationship between him, the mundane world and the constraints therein, and his writing. Walter Sokel points out that although Kafka was not religious in a traditional or organized sense, his thought has a distinctly religious character when viewed in a broader context:

        

The religious nature of Kafka's thinking and sensibility becomes clear if we look at one dominant explanation of the etymology of the word religion. According to this etymology, the Latin word religio, originally signified a holding&back, a restraint, or a bond and denoted a sense of absolute obligation and dependence. In Kafka's case, such religio manifests itself as his sense of living under absolute laws which obligated him in his deepest being but remained incomprehensible to his rational understanding. (4)

The numinous is here in full as it is in The Trial; Kafka's feeling of subservience to an absolute but incomprehensible force is mysterium tremendum in kind. In Description of a Struggle, Kafka describes this sense of personal duty to an unknown superpersonal power, portraying a man who does not think of his personal life or his personal thoughts, but rather it seems to him as though he were living and thinking under the compulsion of a family which in its own right&had superabundance of light and thought, but which for he, according to a law unknown to him, represents a formal necessity. Because of that unknown family and those unknown laws, he cannot be released (Sokel, 4; Kafka, 283). Furthermore, this is not the only religious force present in Kafka's thought; he has fascinans as well, but, naturally, separate and in conflict with mysterium tremendum, what Sokel describes as a double bind in the most literal sense if religio means bond or bind (4). Kafka portrays this metaphorically in Wedding Preparations in the Country, writing of someone who is bound around the neck by two chains fastened to heaven and earth respectively: 

When he desires to move down toward earth, the necklace of heaven strangles him, and when he desires [to raise himself toward] heaven, the earthly chain strangles him. And yet he possesses all possibilities and feels them; he refuses to attribute the whole dilemma to a mistake at the original chaining. (Sokel, 4; Kafka, 46-47) 

As Sokel does well to point out, this metaphor should not be construed in terms of a conflict between the religious and the worldly dimensions of the self&for the earthly chain has itself the force of religio (5); both are numinous entities.

        

In this manner, Kafka's thought shows a distinctly Gnostic flavor that is reflected strongly in the sort of religious imagery and metaphor present in The Trial; Kafka was familiar with Gnostic thought and it is not unlikely that his simultaneous interest between it and Judaism produced the foundation for much of his ontology here (Sokel, 7). To begin with, he professed a belief that death was liberation from life, the dawn of a knowledge which corresponded exactly to the meaning the Gnostics gave the term, (Sokel, 8), and a sentiment linking strongly with the conclusion both of the chaplains parable and The Trials conclusion as a whole:

A first sign of beginning knowledge is the wish to die. This life seems unbearable, another life unattainable. One is no longer ashamed of wanting to die; one asks to be taken out of the old prison cell which one hates and to be brought to a new one which one will learn to hate. But in this wish there also glimmers&faith that during the transport the Lord will perchance pass by, look at the prisoner and say: This one you shall not lock up again. (Wedding Preparations in the Country, 40)

The presence of the possibility of salvation through such transport here, even if not realized as it is not in the death of Josef K., is made overt through the presence of the radiance of the Law and the figure in the window. It reflects exactly the Gnostic sentiment that the world as it is known is a prison, a sort of mundane hell created by a flawed god where humanity is trapped, and that the path to redemption is to escape from it and reach another god, which man originally fell from, that is loving and blissful but entirely outside the known universe (Sokel, 8-9).

        

For the Gnostics the path out of the world to redemption was to gain gnosis, or knowledge; for Kafka it was to write. Sokel touches on this in his description of an instance in an interview between Kafka and Rudolf Steiner, explaining that Kafka asserts to have experienced in literature states (not many) which in [his] opinion are very close to the clairvoyant states described by [Dr. Steiner]&in which [he] felt not only at his own limits, but at the frontiers of the human altogether. Kafka describes his&experiences of writing&in terms customarily reserved for religion (10). He felt called to writing as one might feel called to service of a higher power, and was compelled to estrange himself from&all worldly concernshis job, women, friends, and so onin order to devote himself to an absolute task which feels him as completely as God wants His chosen one to be filled by Him (10). Thus, writing held the position of fascinans for Kafka, upholding one half of that paradigm. The other were exactly those worldly concerns, his obligations to his family, his friends, and his society, that he felt bound by unimpeachably. Kafka writes of his father that when [he] was a child everything [his father] commanded was practically commandment from heaven for [him]. [He] never forget it. It remained the most important means for judging the world; and there [his father] was found wanting utterly&[he] did not adhere to [his] commandments (Wedding Preparations in the Country, 172-73). This disappointment at his fathers simultaneous overarching power and hypocritical contradiction reflects a very similar character to that possessed by the court in The Trial. Kafka's experience of life was one in which the world was a place of intolerable confinement, frustration, disruption, and estrangement, [in which] the constant interruptions with which family, profession, and human relationships in general frustrate his writing&dividing [his life] between the true life away from the world and the false one within it (Sokel, 11-12); in terms of The Trial, one where an insidious web of unimpeachable mundane obligations, the court, keeps him away from redemption, the Law. Walter Benjamin once raised the point that the concept of the laws in Kafka&has mainly a semblance-like character, and that it is in truth only for display (Benjamin, 1250); indeed, they do not indicate laws in the conventional, state-based sense, but rather a larger concept of earthly confinement.

        

It can now be seen at last that The Trial functions as a depiction of the feat Kafka bore of one side of the equation, the mysterium tremendum of overpowering confinement, overcoming the fascinans of redemption. Josef K. can never reach the high court and the Law, where he might be acquitted and saved, but instead is surrounded everywhere by the low court, which ultimately kills him. It is only at the moment of his death when he glimpses the spirit of the Law, as does the main from the country in the chaplains parable, but ultimately is unable to reach it, as in Kafka's metaphor of being lead from prison to prison with the hope of and awareness of the possibility of release. In this manner, it offers a unique window into Kafka's spiritual consciousness, his secular artistic Gnosticism, that allows the reader to feel palpably his dilemma; it has been said of Otto that part of the success of Das Heilige rests in the success of his goal not only to describe the numinous but to produce it in his readers (Poland, 175), a skill which Kafka shares in full. In reading The Trial, one fears the court and its deadly potency as much as he.

part of the reasoning for the religious content of the trial may be Kafka's own upbringing and family life; might make a nice conclusion

josef k.'s unwillingness to not be drawn into interaction with the law or leave parallels in some way Otto's concept of numinous fascination; however, additional points should likely be made; this fascination however reflects a "good" in the holy that draws one to it; josef k's eventual death at the hands of the law may reflect this:

"The daemonic-divine object may appear to the mind an object of horror and dread, but at the same time it is no less something that allures with a potent charm, and the creature, who trembles before it, utterly cowed and cast down, has always at the same time the impulse to turn to it, nay even to make it somehow his own." (Otto, 31)

the good in the law is unreachable as it is linked to an Alien God; consider the 

doorkeeper parable

; the radiance of the law streams forth but is kept from being reached by a doorkeeper who keeps one on earth, like Sophia; 

gnostic parable

It may well be possible, it is even probable, that in the first stage of its development the religious consciousness started with only one of its poles--the 'daunting' aspect of the numen --and so at first took shape only as 'daemonic dread'. But if this did not point to something beyond itself, if it were not but one 'moment' of a completer experience, pressing up gradually into consciousness, then no transition would be possible to the feelings of positive self-surrender to the numen.

Shield. The word you wanted was shield.

It sounds like you're referring to Perseus.

I raised a kitten from the brink of death, too.

I feel the same way about dogs.

I had a similar experience to yours with ghosts but instead with ENERGY, and it transpired when I was younger--ten-eleven.

Hey, what's the World's End Girlfriend album you played for me at the Event?

I got Dream's End Come True, but I don't have any of the others yet.

12:20amAli

that was it

it's an ep, but it was the first thing of theirs I heard, so I thought it'd be good to introduce you to them with

12:20amSaphos

Okay, cool.

Glad I picked it then.

12:21amAli

I <3<3 "Singing Under the Rainbow"

that's the song that really got me into him

12:22amAli

as for albums, I'd grab "The Lie Lay Land" and "Hurtbreak Wonderland" for starters

12:22amSaphos

Alright, thanks

I'll do that

12:23amAli

glad you like him : )

12:24amSaphos

I may well do that, since I really like him so far

12:24amAli

don't forget Kashiwa Daisuke; he's similar, but has his unique sound

as you heard

WEG also did this pretty dark, ambient 5 song album with Mono that's worth looking into

12:32amSaphos

 I had a strange experience when I was in high school. I wrote and I wanted to hang out with other people who wrote so I joined the Creative Writing Club. As it turned out this club was a bizarre sham. 

 At the end of the day I think it's a bit strange to call America "The Land of the Free." I think a better term might be "The Land of the Free to Compete." In America you are free to fight for whatever you want, but if enough other people want something else they are free to smash you to pieces. If one small stuffy Armani-style committee has built a vast crystalline structure with millions of people lined up unawares in the lattices, it can twitch its fingers here and there and the millions will twitch and jerk and smash you and all your friends and all your thoughts to pieces and it was really just the stuffy committee the whole time even though millions were involved. This might seem like a strange perversion of majority rule, but here in America you are free to fight for whatever you goddamn want, and that's the deal, love it or leave it.

Laudanum - album title

I saw a video about this strange invention that consisted of a string of light blue LEDs positioned under your eyes, like eyelashes, that lit up when your head was tilted downwards and went off when your head was tilted upwards. The video opened with the phrase "the big eye obsession" on a black background. A bunch of Japanese girls were wearing them about a cityscape. At first I worried about how odd it would be to kiss one of these girls, but then I realized that I would be kissing the INTANGIBLE FUTURE, and felt better.

I have been out-of-sorts in a very peculiar way since returning to this school. Yesterday I was most disturbed; my insomnia of several nights coupled with the steady wearing-down of break upon my character and the chain of events that followed it conspired to throw my consciousness into a state of disconcerting disarray. This reached a head the night before, while I was trying to sleep and increasingly distressed at my inability to do so, at which point my conception of the world became markedly different and frightening. At one point, I looked upon C.J.'s profile to wish him a confused and delirious "happy birthday" and upon leaving was beset by the text citing him as being in a relationship with you which I viewed as if 'twere new and unseen by me before, and was first perplexed, then terrified, then utterly defeated and rather ready to die. This was one of many instances in which I felt the sheer gravity of my situation as if I was an entirely new person suddenly shunted into it without any prior knowledge or time to be accustomed to it. I stared out my window and saw the trees and grass with utmost fear; I read text on the net and felt it came from a place utterly foreign to me of which I had no conception.

This feeling has not entirely dissipated. It does so in your company, but otherwise I frequently feel the room I'm in is on the verge of collapsing (in the sense that it will fly apart entirely and cease to exist, rather than simply cave in, and in this way this feeling applies equally to the outdoors) and that I myself am held together only by threads so tenuous and hell of wispy a spider covets. I balk at normal conversation and find myself walking away from folk in a most hideous of tizzies shouting about incomprehension. Today, in my Romantic Music class, I found myself staring out the window at the branches outside and feeling unshakably as if they were bearing down upon me and would tear me apart; I consoled myself, as I often do, by ruminating on the guns the security guards carry and the knowledge that in a moment of true desperation they are present and could be possible to use. I am aware that this is a rather disturbing form of consolation, but it is too effective to shirk (depite that I love 2).

However, I must also note that our conversations of late have brought me excessive joy in spite of everything. We seem to have acquired some of that old sense that drew us together when we first spoke with fervor; when I first began contemplating this message yesterday I intended it to include a strong call to the solidarity we share but we in some ways reaffirmed that last night of our own accord. Furthermore, the manner in which we carried on this morning seemed to me phenemonal and reminiscent of us at the very top of our game. My happiness at this did much to carry me through the day.

At this, though, I am caught between twin poles of joy and sorrow and continue to feel as if I might violently dissipate, rendered suddenly inchoate by an inability to concatenate my current and past states. Yesterday I felt I was reborn in some twisted form in which I was encountering everything anew and it was awful and terrifying. Now I fear I'll explode, my heart and liver my abode will receive written from my story on its walls as if hepatoscopially scrying. [And then I feel like dying (if Lil Wayne was Pliny, and I were he).]

There's a bell in my ears, and it shatters

space constantly, its wide, white roar matter

finds irresistable, shudders at, splits,

the whole universe destroyed, as my wits,

and it tolls for thee! To your voice alone

it harkens and speaks in its deepest tone.

Lo! See what lengths you have driven me to:

a poem to break through bell-like to you.

Your wonder in verse I cannot address,

for at it you would be incredulous.

For you to shine more bright in these contents

than unswept stone would disturb your self-sense,

so you'd toss them out your interior,

feeling yourself to them inferior.

A rose's eyes, face-set, see just its thorns;

its face, unseen, it too by proxy scorns.

I spoke yesterday to Emanuel,

who in Finland's name, now rallying, calls

against you, as breaker of Finnish bonds.

But his stigmata appeared painted on,

a mere mimesis of those of the lore,

so I was made doubtful, and furthermore

the categorical imperative

would make him wrong, allowing you to live.

Then again, I remain in damnation;

he might speak as the son of Creation.

The waxwing loves the false azure he sees

reflected in the windowpane, and flees

his present circumstances to meet her,

as Graves runs pen-wards, meeting Demeter.

At the moment of their union he's surprised;

striking the window, dismembered, he dies.

I feel I'm now his fluff smudge that persists

gone forth, in the reflected sky, to list

to my own teachings, while from all around:

mourning; I fall a little further down.

I am kept aloft now only by hope.

If not for that my sharp sorrow's sheer scope

would have me cleft right down to my center,

leaving me only the Mod to enter

immoliated. A most maudlin fate;

luckily my love surpasses its weight.

My augaury poor, I cannot now tell

what the future holds; it might end the bell.

From the top of the flight of the wide, white stairs,

through the rest of my life--do you wait for me there?

With love,

Zack

this is music for when you feel you are in a tiny snug fox den in a cold place at the edge of the universe. [sometimes I feel that way and so I have had to figure out music for it.] [it seems like you are maybe in that sort of a place.]

Dear Kerrah,

Smidgens,

Zack

'ullo Brooke--

I've reviewed your application and resume and within seconds found that my wife had been chopped to pieces by the neighborhood axe murder and like the good John Doe I beat my children to death in a blind rage. I did see my wife put herself back together through the kitchen window but I had already set off--you've inspired me to seek new frontiers and needless to say I found your application wholly compelling and your resume impressively in order. Your proposed role in my plan is phenomenal to say the least: people will be so overcome with compassion and pathos that they will not only be unable to bring themselves to offer any kind of resistance to our victory chariot but doubtless will sing our praises and assume we are some sort of kindhearted liberators--which we WILL BE

I don't believe we've met, until now. A'course, if I was some post-acquiantance bent on vengeance I probably would say exactly that, and as for being the hired hand of a hidden hostile higher power--well, I just can't speak there, can I. But I am probably--probably--not those things, so I think you can rest easy.

So, a'ight, anyway, here's how this visionary plan is gonna go: much bigger. Larger. More grande. You have pushed things in completely the proper direction. Thank you. We're definitely gonna commandeer a kickass black chopper and sidecar, but not only that, oh no, no: we're also gonna commandeer a huge black camper to tow behind us, and we're gonna paint giant boss lightning bolts on the side of it and hang Moreau's "Jupiter and Semele" on the back:

http://cfs5.tistory.com/upload_control/download.blog?fhandle=YmxvZzcyOTcxQGZzNS50aXN0b3J5LmNvbTovYXR0YWNoLzAvMDcwMDAwMDAwMDAyLmpwZw%3D%3D

Now, the camper's gotta be huge for this reason: we need a bigger coil. The one I made when I was twelve is, well, one I made when I was twelve. It's like the size of a table. Nikola Tesla himself once built one on top of his laboratory in Colorado Springs that was so large it produced 30-foot-long glowing bolts that shattered surrounding streets and houses and caused neighborhood earthquakes. They kicked him out of town for that--but he didn't have a kickin' chopper.

I think you can see where this is going.

I'll put a brick on the accelerator and stand on the handlebars wielding my Guitaranatopsis. You'll reign in the sidecar eating raw stakes and entire live sharks off a charred Flying V. If we put two paper clips on either side of the toroid, we can careen through city streets and scream across highways and soar over the Grand Canyon and the oceans and the heavenly burning sun while everything around us explodes. We'll pass into myth and the few human beings left alive will remember us as the twisted Abraxes who made the new world.

[And, if at any point we have to end it all, we can drive through a car wash and touch that car wash in a way no car wash has ever been touched before.]

I suggest we start our odyssey off with this rousing number:

plum season is almost here

P.S. I do at least have some gnarly scars that you can feel the lacing through, but I've also been saying for years that the only future I'm hoping for is a post-apocalyptic one where I'll be part human and part cybernetic Lovecraftian sea god, so if it all goes right wearing that lacing skinside will be just the beginning.

Dear Emsony,

Or should I call you Liz? Or something else? What do you go by these days?

I'm sorry I have been the worst possible correspondent up to this point by sending you zero letters. That's a travesty, I think, and not fair at all, I think. 

To FCC Commissioners Genachowski, Clyburn and McDowell:

If the role of the FCC is in part to preserve diversity of expression and access in media, I believe lifting this ban would be contrary to the goals of the Commission.

The rampancy of media consolidation in this country today presents a grim and undesirable trend. Americans looking to get the news are presented with an increasingly narrow mainstream of sources that present information of a tightly limited scope and perspective. There is nothing, of course, nothing inherently objectionable about the presence of that scope in the media landscape, but when it is the only one broadly available, it is unchecked by competing journalistic approaches that would hold it to the high standards we need as a free democratic nation. Major news outlets today often fail to cover stories that are unarguably significant, affecting millions of Americans, when they fail to fall within their narrow scope, and are increasingly featuring subjective commentary to the detriment of their journalistic objectivity.

The solution to this problem would be to take action to encourage greater competition in the marketplace, not less. Commissioner McDowell, your statement that the notion that broadcasters may distribute their content through radio, television, the Internet, mobile devices and other unforeseen portals, but must be prohibited by law from printing the same content on the medium of newsprint, seems anachronistic at best appears to me to describe the present situation accurately but miss the most vital point: the media landscape is barren because a few large broadcasters are allowed to operate so widely. 

Uphold the ban on newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership and consider dividing the market even more thoroughly between content portals to encourage a larger number of smaller, more specialized media companies as opposed to the handful of massive conglomerates we currently have. We need a competitive, diverse media landscape for our democracy to function as intended.

Best wishes,

Zack Anderson

Who am I? Am I a boy who plays bass guitar in a sludge rock band and eats the heads off chickens? Am I one of those girls who makes tiny bird purses out of felt and sells them on Etsy? Am I a mariner? Am I a whale? I have no idea. All I got at the End-Of-Adolescence Identity Station was that Time magazine I have from 1963--the one with Soviet spacecrafts and sailboats and . Oh well.

So, anyway, one or two of you may have noted that, despite having had a LiveJournal since I was fourteen and not being against posting in it, I usually do so about twice a year, at best (the others of you probably have not noticed, because the infrequency of my posting would tend to put my journal out of mind). There are two reasons for this, which cross my mind every time I think of something I could post here (which, counterintuitively, is as often as a couple of times a day):

2. Why should anyone want to read anything I write about myself, you know?

I have come to the realization, over too long a time, that this is silly. After all, I read things you folks write about yourselves and your interests and activities and such all the time with great enjoyment, and it stands to reason that you probably would not have friended me if you did not want to read the same from my end. So, with that in mind, I am going to do my best to get over myself and actually make regular use of this thing, rather than using it exclusively for two-second shout-outs to cetaceans, celestial events, or other things that will probably never read them. To get off to a proper start, I have used it today with Extra Vigor.

I have an apartment now. It is in South Egremont, MA, in back of an antiques shop, and has a flower garden outside. I really like how the lease has a "Quiet Enjoyment" clause, specifying that as long as I do everything I am supposed to do, I "shall and may peacefully and quietly have, hold and enjoy" my apartment. Yes, indeed.

It was pleasingly like a razor blade with a Red Meat strip pasted on it.

Does anyone have any questions for me?

i spend far too much money on books. crazy money. money i don't really have a'tall. but they're important, i need 'em to write with, they help me look out at th' ether. harrrrumph! i think i have to call a deadly moratorium on bookbuyin' fer a while. i have a lot to read now anyhow.

I went to a wonderful party last night! I haven't said that about a party in over a year so <i>jesus</i> that's an improvement in my life sich'ae-shun.

I got internet, finally! You may've gathered if y' knew I was knetless from th' fact that there's an entry here. The connection is insanely fast. It's fast as fuck! I've never had a connection this fast at home before. I'm terribly pleased. Setting it up was a godawful Sisyphean roadblock mess but it's all over now. Baby. Blue.

Oh, that sounds good!

I'm really lonely, honestly, though less for lack of company (I go to sundry parties and shows) than for misanthropy--I jus' seem to knee-jerk hate nearly everyone new I meet, and my stunning lack of internal regard for the well-being of my fellow people is as mouth-frothing as always (I'm nice as pudding to most folks unless they cross some sort of a...line, but that doesn't stop me spending all day damning th' hell out of them--how on Earth does that work, damning th' hell out of somebody? I guess I know as well as anyone). On that note, I read "Everything that Rises Must Converge," by Flannery O'Connor, today and reveled in every second of it--what a damn good story. How proper! Anyway, I'm not really sure what to do about this except to keep meeting new people, but a'course that has the double-edged quality of continually cementing my pessimism about finding people I get along with. It doesn't help that every time I do meet someone I like pretty well they turn out to be so remarkably busy as to cause making good friends with them to be impossible (seriously--the ratio of folks whom I've met relatively recently and like for whom this is true to those thus qualified for whom it is not is 4:0--hideous). I guess I can always make friends with the lake, who has all the time in the world.

I think of you often, and I'm sorry I let my correspondenshiness get in the way of it showing. 

"I used to want to eat chalk...I read East of Eden by John Steinbeck and it made me want to eat chalk." -- Liz Groebel

[weepin', websites, etc.] Is it just me or I am I basically a cute 25-year-old girl who lives in an apartment in Brooklyn with two cats.

Then again not entirely because I also do things like this:

[stagedive punch]

Of course in actuality I am just a whale that lives in the ocean and is nice to people.

hesitant to talk about mental illness and sexuality and stuff maybe partially because it seems like a lot of people bring those things up to portray themselves as special and unique, and they seem like illegitimate things to do that with because they are such common issues, and that aggravates me and I don't want to be party to that kind of behavior; however, they can also be an impactful part of a person's life, so that if they are talking about their life it eventually becomes unwieldy not to mention them

I vacillate between thinking I will live beyond a hundred and die by my own hands before I hit fifty. This is, on the one hand, because I eat well (despite my love of chicken-fried bacon and grossly tall chocolate cakes, I mostly eat like seasoned and broiled fish and Portuguese sausage-and-kale soups and pickled seaweed and stuff), exercise a lot, have a good history of people in my family living to ripe old age, and am favored by the projected increases in life expectancy in the coming century. On the other hand, I am strongly considering buying a gun on the sole basis that I think I would feel much more comfortable and secure if I knew that if I ever really wanted to kill myself, I could without much effort. I also get an urge to jump into the ocean every time I am on a boat so powerful that at times it has moved me to tears. Other things that have moved me to tears: striking visions of glowing celestial turbines and a dark apocalypse forged at my own hands after I attain a strange omnipotence, seen in the third person, during my playwrighting class, removing me from the discussion for a half-hour while I silently weep. Am I a raving lunatic? I guess I am able to like drive a car without incident and whatnot at least.

While there is a good record of people liven' t' be real old in my family, there is also a strong history of neurological and psychological illness.

Media Playscape

This is a space for pure, constant, collaborative media creation with no goal but pleasure. You can put anything you want here, in any state, as long as you are interested in seeing it continually reworked and expanded upon. Have a poem you're not happy with? Toss it into the playscape and let everyone else finish it. A beat you don't want to lay down instruments and vocals for? Toss it into the playscape and watch as ten finished songs emerge. A video you want remixed? A pamphlet you're working on? A plan for an organization? A recipe? A science experiment? An architectural blueprint? A political theory? This is an exposed, wild petri dish--anything put here comes into fascinating, unpredictable life.

This is a place for artists and media generators of all types to workplay without constraints. Here we are unworried about profit, ownership, or publication--only making something good in the moment.

How it works:

Page through the table of contents until you find something you're interested in working on. Hit "edit" and have at it! Have something new you want to put up? Edit the table of contents to make a new entry. (Please don't delete entries in the table of contents, even if they're yours--just because you don't like something now doesn't mean it won't get good later. Edit it to nudge it towards a direction you like instead!) If you like, you can put a short description after the link--just remember that others may modify or erase it as whatever you put up changes. And remember that people may take things you put up in directions you didn't want or intend! Just roll with it. If you're really not into it just make a new entry and put the original up again--something new will happen this time.

Cheeeeers!

In some ways (maybe a lot of ways) Eugene is proving to be unsatisfying. I don't regret coming if for no other reason than I have learned things and became more able (I think) through the struggle, but I actually dislike what I've seen of the culture here. It's very flat and schticky--people here seem less interested in genuine human connection than they are in fitting into some kind of played-out cultural role and keeping you at a distance. I haven't really encountered anyone at large here who seems at all unique--people seem inclined to bury their uniqueness behind an impenetrable screen. To some degree that dynamic exists everywhere of course but in Austin say you do sometimes see people who are uniquely dressed, or have what seems to be an idiosyncratic way of talking, or something, whereas here /everyone/ seems like an iteration of a stock type--they're a grungy raver, or a businessperson, or a bookish hipster, or something like that, and they make zero effort to reach you in any way beyond the surface of their "type." People are polite but in a detached way--I like it way less than the default jovial friendliness of Texas and even less than the default gruffness of the East Coast. People will smile at you and shake your hand and answer your questions and whatnot but never even put on the pretense of being genuinely pleased by your presence. Sometimes I go out and do outlandish things in public just to try to get some sort of an interesting reaction out of the people here but everyone just skims over my clothes and actions as if I'm doing nothing in particular.

It makes me miss Chicago. There everyone was like really reactive and into the people around them. I had like multiple conversations in which total strangers ran up to me on the street and started talking to me and had like all sorts of neat things to say or at least a quick comment or two to share that resonated with me. People responded to the clothes I wore and I saw other people dressed in fascinating and genuinely expressive ways. There were even some local bands that seemed pretty good. I'm not sure where I should go next. I may go back to Austin as I've been thinking, but I might also like to go to there. 

Actually the more I think about it the more I feel like it rather depends on what your post-graduation plans are. Would you have any interest in going to Chicago? I miss you. A lot of the appeal of returning to Austin for me actually lies in like being able to hang out with you.

The nuts-and-bolts aspects of my writing process vary from piece to piece but I think there are consistent patterns in the way in which I set up those nuts and bolts. As I pawed at earlier I think of myself as an "experimental" writer in the literal sense that I approach writing as setting up an experiment and carrying it out to see what happens. I feel I have the highest level of conscious, intentional control over a piece at the very beginning, before I put any of the piece onto the page, because once I start really writing a different part of myself takes over and all my executive function can do is try to give suggestions while this goes on. As such the beginning of my process often involves me tweaking a basic concept or "set of conditions" sort of meticulously--I have a certain language mechanism I want to use for structure, or a certain progression I want to distill, or a setting for characters or something. I don't necessarily have a good idea of what piece something like this will generate, but I'll spend weeks often just turning it over, changing little parts of it, trying to gather material, and what I'm really trying to do is get it into a configuration where that other part of myself will suddenly generate a paragraph or two of the piece in response. When I've got it set up well enough this just happens, and it could happen anywhere--often if I get material like that in a place where I can't write immediately I'll think it over and over to myself so I have it in my memory. I'm often carrying around a few kernels like that sort of waiting until I feel comfortable enough to actually start writing them down, and either I eventually get the urge and start writing them or I start to feel they're not quite what I want and abandon them.

Outside of that everything is pretty automatic, even revision, and often that part of myself will generate material without me having given it any sort of structure to play with and I will find myself drawn compulsively to the computer and sometimes will write continuously in a sort of daze until the piece is over, or if it's on the longer side this will happen on and off, but like quite frequently, for a few days. I started writing heavily for the first time in years last November when four poems just like barreled into my thoughts over the course of three days or so with no intention on my part of making that happen, and ever since then that part of myself has been very alive.

A lot of the conscious, intentional parts of my process that aren't about setup are about trying to live in ways that stimulates that part of myself. I try to read stuff in the area I'm trying to write in daily--fiction or poetry, usually--just to keep my thoughts in that sort of a rhythm if nothing else. I try to process a lot of other media too so I stay focused on the larger, more essential picture--film is really helpful. I keep a diary and try to write at least something every day. I try to give myself a lot of free time and lee-way, and spend a lot of it alone.

I totally agree--I think I've felt that way for years, and more and more so as time goes on. "Modern life" seems to me to be heavily predicated on like a couple of basic misunderstandings about the essence of living--but then again, I go back and forth between feeling that way and like my experience of the world must be so different from the people around me that what they are doing genuinely is working for them even though it wouldn't for me at all. I often feel that the things you describe /do/ have worth--a career, a family, American culture--but not as thought of by people here generally. I think when I define those things in ways that make them sound interesting or appealing to me I am defining them in ways that the people around me seem never to at all.

That Yeats quote does seem sadly accurate. If the mob has false ideas it's much easier to be carried by those false ideas because the mob will pick you up. You can feel more assured in them. If in such a world you have true ideas you will be inclined to doubt them because the picture of the mob will make them look false.

I think it's a fine structure! Might be fun to paw at while intoxicated one way or another. Seems like a story that could generate interesting dynamics from impulsive movements, maybe.

I'd love to talk about crit theory with you! As I've said I think you may find its basic approach off-putting out of your training in analytic philosophy--it's concerned with different parts of human experience that lead crit theorists to say all sorts of things that it seems like can't really be said in any meaningful way in an analytic framework. Although of course a lot of crit theory is considered "continental philosophy" and much of its luminaries are or were self-identified or employed as philosophers, I think of it as being more closely related to sociology, academic history, or political science than any philosophical tradition outside of itself. In a lot of ways it's the "reverse image" of mainstream sociology--whereas mainstream sociologists are very concerned with quantity and tend to back up their conclusions with numerical data and scientific work, crit theorists are very concerned with quality and tend to back up their conclusions with experiences and interior observations they've had. Sociology makes itself out to be a kind of science; crit theory makes itself out to be almost a kind of art. It has a literary quality.

Someone who really endorses the analytic approach would probably be inclined to call all crit theory bunk on the basis that it plays fast and loose with concepts that the analytic philosopher would say we don't know about well enough to use aside from looking at them straight ahead. On the flip side, analytic philosophy seems relatively unable to wrangle with certain concepts that are undeniably major parts of the human experience, as major as the sort of experiential "building blocks" that are dealt with in the analytic tradition but a lot more "fuzzy"--gender, say. An analytic philosopher might have a hard time feeling comfortable saying much about gender aside from looking at its most essential components--they probably wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole a paper about something like the public rituals of gender in urban West Africa where a crit theorist would feel pretty comfortable. Ironically, perhaps, a lot of crit theorists seem to have a similar reaction to analytic work--they are often skeptical of anything particularly quantitative or "formal" and will point to quantitative discourse as a means of concealing and enforcing qualitative values. Just as an analytic philosopher might question the logical assumptions behind a crit theory paper, a crit theorist might question the assumptions about the human experience behind an analytic paper.

Of course, crit theory suffers from heavy jargon tendencies as much as any other discipline of its type and that can totally be a barrier to accessing it, but I imagine you're more put off by its tools than its language. What have you been reading?

My name is Mitch. I have recently built a shed out of plywood. My hobbies include building sheds out of plywood. Sometimes I ride my bike. Other times I build bikes out of plywood. I built my father a bike out of four solid sheets of heavy plywood. It was fun. I build people out of plywood. They tell me jokes. I post these jokes on my website, www.plywoodpeopletellingjokes.com. It's a good quality website. It's made of plywood. I construct all things out of plywood. I created my yard using only one small sheet of chiseled granite. I actually build many things out of grandmothers. My grandmother does not approve of the construction of objects using grandmothers, but I don't really care about her opinion, because she's only a grandmother and cannot exactly defend herself, should the situation arise that I should feel the need to knock her unconscious. One fine November afternoon, I decided to take my grandmother for a walk down to the lake, where she swam around in circles in the water for three hours. I threw in a few grains of rice, which she gobbled up hungrily. I smiled at her innocence. One day she would realize that being a grandmother was only the first ticket to becoming an idolized gorilla. My grandmother has always aspired to become a gorilla and then proceed to influence many people and therefore become extremely famous. She has been excessively taking classes in the field of Gorilla-Becoming and the Art of Being Influential. I have urged her to use her skills in the field of physics to become a professional physic, but she keeps killing small rodents with her scimitar, which subtracts points from her total number of reputation points, lowering her likelihood of achieving any of her goals.

I had a very meaningful dream.

notes:

in high school to get RAPs, but had to take a bunch of other classes too (due to administration mix-up/stupid regulations? was going to deal with that)

not adhering to high school system; skirting work, skipping class, generally not engaging, but demonstrating that I was more capable than other students

other rockers there breaking system with me (c.j. showing up halfway through the day, dara and I not doing the assignment in that debate class but instead proving that the question posed was flawed)

developing connection with mob boss (skip class to hang out with him, wore a light tan suit and matching fedora, carried a gun, had me perform mob jobs and told me about the dealings and ways of the mob)

afraid of mob boss because I was trusting him and sort of defenseless against him and I knew he could be ruthlessly violent (was worried he might kill me if he thought I was going to rat out the mob because I knew he wasn't sure if he could trust me yet)

taken to parking garage by him after leaving school; really apprehensive; went up elevator with him and when we got to the next floor and the door opened he stepped out and turned and pulled a gun on me; I knocked it out of his hand and jumped past him out of the elevator; crowd of men there all carrying guns; at first I thought they were cops but they turned out to be mobsters; turned out I had passed their initiation test and made it into the mob; was given a circular (Roman?) blue shield as an initiation gift; after that woke up

Coincidentally, I went to the same high school as Ethan, until I left to attend college early. It's a small world, I guess.

The most notable characteristic of Montessori schools is that they allow students a great degree of freedom of study and pace. Especially at an early level, they take the position that if students are given the materials to learn and shown how to use them, they will be naturally inclined to do so and will come to a love of learning that stems from within them, as opposed to having learning imposed on them externally in a manner that disavows them of agency. This teaches them to pursue learning on their own and associates feelings of personal achievment and progress with it from an early age, as opposed to the impressions that the public school system gives of learning being a cumbersome task imposed upon you by a societal framework that you are given no personal stake in.  Maria Montessori held that children have a natural desire to learn that remains present unless they are somehow taught to think negatively of it, and that if you give a child the resources to learn without that negative impression they will inherently do so. My experience to date causes me to agree with her.

Another benefit of a Montessori education is that it allows a child to move at thier own pace, rather than that imposed by the school system. This was of great benefit to me and my peers as we frequently wanted to move at a pace 

Hi! So, I have a question: six of my friends are coming to stay at your hostel this weekend; they booked a private room for six under the name Katie Corcoran. When they booked the room, it looked like I wasn't going to be able to go, but now I can; I was wondering if, if I payed the price for a bed for three nights (which I guess comes out to about $53 USD?) I could just stay in that room with them. If not, should I book a bed somewhere else in the building? Thanks.

My dear friends: I'm depressed, and became so about four days ago, so if I don't respond to you on the internet or the phone much, please know that I still think you are miraculous. Please let's hang out whenever it is that I feel better, hopefully soon. I will do my best to stay in touch, and be physically about in the world if I'm up to it.

 

The same mistake

 Two old men sit in a nice quiet park playing backgammon. They tap their long nails on the park table and drink their dark beer to help them feel casual, silently. The man in front--a fine-trimmed professor beard, beer foam reclining softly on his mustache--plays white. The man in back, with a clean-shaven lengthy gaunt face, pale blue eyes permanently on point, an unforgiving rancher, plays red. The man in front gets the first turn and a bit into midgame he takes a small but definite lead. He makes a die roll that splays tantalizing through his gut, giving him the feeling of a whole tree of paths to chase that roll into a win. He begins to line up the game's bits as play continues according to this suggested configuration.

 But, as everything cascades downwards, the man in back cruises along towards an ever-more-inevitable victory, one invisible at first but quickly crawling all over the game as it draws to a finish. Soon he bears all his chips off, the end of a steady avalanche. The man in front blinks leans back sllloooow and lets his arms drop. Despite all the millions of routes eroded out by fortune at the instant of each die roll, at the last move he knows in a flash the gleam of promise he saw and followed was pure mirage, unattainable in any universe.

 I stood in the wide field in front of Adams, pulling in the violet-and-wheat smell of New England autumn at dusk. Being in unfamiliar territory, I automatically listened for birdsong I'd never heard. I mussed two of my cigarettes before rolling a good one, distracted by the richness of my environment; with my success I was free to revel in it. Soon all the beautiful cream moths would cover all the lights in the whole college and it would all decay in the dark and control of the school would pass to the moths. Fauns danced just out of view in the nearby wood, leading plump German children singing into pit traps. The strong winds carrying the night in whipped my skirt around like hung canvas, but I'd been smart enough to put on thick knit tights, beloved art-deco-wallpaper tights, and they kept me just warm enough not to complain.

 Nick came running out of Adams, a sudden explosion of sherbet colors, with a headband of Allison's. Her black hair now unwillingly let down flowed out behind her. He tossed the headband to me and I tried to run but my boots gave me no traction on the wet grass and I immediately fell to the ground, a bright field of laughter, the headband a foot away from my nose. Allison walked over and picked it up deftly as if lifting a telephone receiver.

 "Bra," said Nick above me. "Have you just been out here the whole time?"

 "Yeah," I said. "I've been listening for unusual birds."

 "For some reason they don't seem to make much noise at dusk here," said Allison in her tight nasal fashion. "Back in Kansas City they'd gather in the trees and seriously make a racket."

 "Maybe it's just too cold," I said. I sighed and closed my eyes. Almost immediately I felt cloth on my face. I opened my eyes and dimly saw Nick through a field of pale colors. 

 "Wait--," I said, "is this my handkerchief?" I pulled it off and looked at it. Red cream prairie checkered, everywhere my essence. "Oh my God, what the fuck?" I laughed. "Where was it?"

 "i found it under the bed," said Nick. "It must have fallen out of your bag."

 "Oh," I said, still laughing. "Well, thanks, I guess." I maneuvered it into a skirt pocket, looked up at the sky, and watched the stars for a few seconds. Suddenly I saw a meteor--a penny thrown in the world's largest fountain.

 "God doesn't need wishes," I said.

 "What?" said Allison.

 "He just threw a penny," I said grinning. "What a waste."

 "Bra," said Nick. "Po go lo trill ho to mo ko, bra." He kneeled and began softly stroking my left arm, then made a face like he was so disgusted he was about to start weeping and emitted a harsh noise, like a choking seal. I knew he was just fucking around, but to see him make that face as he touched me made me feel suddenly distraught, his clear blue Arctic morning eyes almost wholly concealed by his tensed-up cheeks.

 "Ugggghhhh!" said Allison, laughing, icked out by Nick's expression. She pretended to back away in horror but then fell over. "Hahahahahaha," she said from the grass. Nick jumped on top of her and said "Mimimimimi, mimimimi" in the voice of an old Spanish man as he tried to lick her forehead and she tried to push him off.

 I pulled myself up and stared away at the horizon. On the top of one of the hills, a huge spotlight revolved around and around like a lighthouse. It was the only point of light in an otherwise thick dark landscape of pine forest. It was almost as good as watching the stars.

 "Bra," said Nick, coming up behind me. "Are you looking at the Beacon of Hope, bra?"

 Nick spent two months working on a farm in Hawaii last year and afterwards began calling people "bra" as a joke to himself. Once he asked a hookah shop owner about calling people "bra":

 "What kind of impression does it give you," he said to the hookah man, who had a shaved head looking permanently unpurturbed, "if I, being the kind of person that I am, call people 'bra'?" Nick had a t-shirt on that said "just another SEXY pregnant woman".

 "I dunno," said Mister Hookah, seeming to take nothing in at all about the situation. "It seems kinda douchey really."

 "Huh," said Nick. "Yeah, okay." He bought some salvia, said, "Later, bra," and we left. "What a bra," he said, as we got in the car.

 "Is that the Beacon of Hope?" I said.

 "Yeah," said Nick. "It's helped me out a lot in dark times. Last term I used to look out my window at it constantly while I was writing papers. I haven't payed as much attention to it this term since like things are going so much better for me."

 "That's nice," I said. "It's good that you had something to take solace in." We both stared at it for a few seconds, saying nothing. 

 "It seems sort of sad, in a way--it's so far off," I said.

 "That's true. I've never been up there."

 "Probably you could walk for years and never reach it."

 "Yeah," Nick said. "It's shining in from another world."

 As the night cascaded downwards, all the events lining up one after another each unexpected falling pachinko as they do in these contexts, we ended up at a house party, some of Allison's friends, where punk bands played in the kitchen. Aaron, Nick's new boyfriend, had joined us by this point. Nick had previously dated a girl Melissa who threw a chair at him once, got into fits where she said everything he did was just a cheap sham, he hadn't actually read any of the books he liked to talk about and so on and so on. Nick's sweet and this really wasn't at all all right obviously. Aaron seemed like a step up, for sure, but he was sort of beige, he came off like he had a kind of alternative computer programmer personality. He was a dedicated painter but all his paintings were just pastel washes, almost Waldorf school atrium paintings. A bit of a mystery.

 The first band we saw was pretty good, really punchy klezmer, a thick-beard clarinetist and a lean tall tuba player trading lead. It was nice and they even got people jumping off the countertops as is proper. But the next band that came on was less ideal--they were a hardcore band basically but determined to be proggishly witty and came off real over-precious. They had some name like Gizzard or Whiskers. I wished they would just play some actual hardcore because they seemed like they might've been actually good at it and as it was the crowd was just standing around now slack-jawed doing nothing. Nick and Aaron had wandered off and I was standing around with Allison's plaid shirt friends whom I didn't really know.

 Suddenly Pigeons or whatever they were changed up their style and began sounding familiar. I thought for a second and realized they were doing a straight cover of "I'm So Happy When You're Near". This was really the last straw.

 "Jesus fucking Christ," I said to the room at large. "How fucking hip!" I stormed out right then.

 Outside it was good and cold, a thin fog hung about, the streetlamps all jellyfish. I faced away from the doors of the house, staring into the woods an attractive ten yards away, and rolled a cigarette, the band inside reduced to a faint rumbling noise. It was all much nicer.

 "Cool spats," said someone to my left, looking down at my feet, I guess, about ten seconds after I took my first drag and was really starting to calm down. Took a sidelong glance--greasy black-haired fellow, the kind with a beanie and three years of a film degree.

 "Thanks," I said, staring back into the woods. I had no interest in eye contact.

 "Where'd you get them?"

 "I made them," I said.

 "Cool," he said. "Hey, can I bum a cigarette?"

 I pulled out the tobacco pouch again, and was about to start going through the motions, but he said, "Oh, that's cool, you don't have to roll me one. I thought you might have some ready to go, uh, I guess," so I put the pouch back and zipped my bag up. "So, yeah, what are you majoring in?" he said.

 "I majored in literature, but I already got my degree," I said. "I'm here visiting a friend." I actually majored in hermeneutics but I don't like trying to tell strangers what hermeneutics is.

 "Oh cool." he said.

 "Yeah," I said.

 Waiting, waiting. Waiting. Okay. "I think I'm going to take off," I said. "Have a good night." I walked towards the forest.

 "Oh, uh, yeah, you too," he said after me.

 The woods were cool and peaty and private and a weighty relief. I knew a way through them from there to Aaron's room, Nick and Aaron's regular haunt since I was sleeping in Nick's. I felt deliciously alone and the woods awakened an almost desperate desire in me to live in them forever. I fantasized about carving a den out of a hillside with my hands and supporting it with gathered sticks, growing a small plot of mushrooms, deerskin shoes. White ribbon tendrils played rapidly around the tree branches as glowing blue discs orbited my hands.

 Nick and Aaron were lying in bed together.

 "You guys are too cute," I said walking in. They held each other tightly and made pouty duck faces at me. I sat down on the floor and took out my laptop.

 "Aaadaaa," said Aaron. "We were just talking about how it's really sad that there are no counts anymore for you to marry."

 "Are you high?" I said.

 "Yeeeeeeeesss," said Nick, in a voice imitating sort of a squeaky valley girl with laryngitis. He grabbed a pipe and a lighter from his endtable and offered them to me. I thought about it for a second. 

 "Yeah, okay," I said. 

 Nick beamed. "You're a bra, bra."

 I took a hit, put the pipe on the floor, and pulled a white bra out of my messenger bag as I held my breath. "Bra," I said, holding it over my head, and exhaled.

 Nick grabbed it from me and clasped it over his eyes. "Mimimimi, mimimimi," he said when he was finished, writhing around on the bed with his hands formed into points, like pterodactyl claws, a surreally cute creature.

 "Oh my god, stop it," said Aaron, who was being pushed against the wall.

 "Oh, sorry," said Nick, and took the bra off his face. He handed it back to me and leaned over to Aaron, kissing him on the cheek. "Sooooorryyy," he said again but in the bronchitis valley girl voice. Aaron turned to kiss him for real, and I started drawing golden doves in Illustrator to give them some privacy, feeling morose again. Nick's toe, hanging off the bed, brushed my calf, and my stomach dropped for a second.

 Almost surprised, I wandered into thinking it all over and gradually found myself remembering a dream I'd had three months ago that I hadn't dwelled on heavily aside from its pleasantness, thinking it was more or less regular weird sex dream fare. I was running from Nazis in the French countryside, always leaving town just at the moment a black-clad agent sauntered into the most exterior café. Near the dream's end I decided to hide out and took work at a dairy farm. Standing in the front of the barn washing out a bucket, the ends of my long white sleeves wet and muddy, Nick strolled into view from the barn's left side. I smiled and waved, as if he was a regular fixture, and he just walked right up and I lay down in the hay pile behind me, cupped my hands around his smooth elbows like birch trunks and tugged. He pulled down my skirt no talking and we fell hazily into it, dark all over me, my hands faint on his suddenly naked back the hay pure bird's nest comfort wrapped warm around each other pillowy quiet like a bear's den.

 I looked up at Nick and Aaron on the bed and felt the whole situation very loudly, realizing my resistance had been completely worn away. The room cracked and fell apart--another notch in my Tartarean wheel. My life the same mistake over and over.

 "I need to go to the bathroom," I said, picking my bag up off the floor.

 "Ada--?" said Aaron, as I passed through the doorway, casting a small hook, bait I would not take.

 The night cold and almost toxically fresh, dark starry sky twinkling and undulating with pot ripples, I made my way down the road between the rows of small dorms and fixed my eyes on the high horizon, hoping desperately that no one would try to talk to me. The few minutes back to Nick's room were harrowing but I made it. I fished out a pen and a Cumby's receipt from the mound of playful clutter on his desk and wrote him a note.

 "I've left--I'll explain later, I know you'll understand, it's so so like me--I'm sorry, I'm not angry or anything--

 -- 

 

Ada"

 

 I left and made my way bit by bit towards the long road that led to the campus gates. One of the student shuttles muscled loud brash past me going the other way, onto campus, and I knew it would come back out to town in around four minutes, so I lay down in the grass next to the road, stared at the sky, and decided to cry silently. Soon enough tears were running sideways out of my eyes into the dirt.

 When I heard the shuttle I stood up, wiped off my face and waved it down. There was nothing about me to suggest that I wasn't a student and I hoped they wouldn't ask any questions.

 "Where're y' goin'?" An old grizzled sandy-haired fellow in a North Face windbreaker comfortable and easy at the wheel.

 "Um, the bus station?" I said.

 He nodded a few times. I just waited there for him to do something else, and he said, "Go ahead, hop in," so I did, and sat in the back.

 I watched the pine trees stream by out the window of the shuttle and let myself cry again, head on the window, left eye tears wandering rivulets and deltas on the glass. The shuttle driver was listening to fascinatingly hideous ballads on the adult contemporary station, and I didn't have it in me to burst his comfort bubble by asking him to turn it off. A few minutes later we began to drive past a lake, just barely hidden by the forest.

 "Um, sir?" I said, trying not to sound like I'd been crying.

 "Yeah?" he said. He didn't seem to notice anything was amiss, but maybe he was just being polite.

 "Is it okay if we stop here for a few minutes?"

 He thought for a moment. "Okay," he said, and started to pull over. "What for?"

 "Is it all right if I stand by the lake for a little while? I'm not feeling very well."

 "You mean like you're sick?"

 "Just--I'm not in a very good mood."

 He seemed to sense something he didn't understand but felt obligated to deference through. "Well, all right, but, uh, you've got about three minutes. I've gotta be back on campus by 11:00."

 "That's fine," I said. "Thank you."

 I got out and walked through the trees to the dock at the edge of the lake. The lake was surrounded by forest on all sides. A flock of geese out late on the town sang loudly on the far bank, awfully oblivious to the tragedy thundering around them. They all had on ties and jackets. They clinked their martinis and pulled on their fat cigars like gangsters.

 Oh, but Nick, I thought. You are no Eurydice. You are alive and hale forever, and I'm Persephone anyway, on account of my Seasonal Affective Disorder. 

 I almost laughed, but caught myself. I stood on the very edge of the dock, so I couldn't see any of it, and tried to imagine that I was standing on the surface of the water, and that only the force of my will kept me afloat, and I could drop if I wanted any second. It made me feel a bit better. I thought of a poem I had written staying in Reading last winter, and said it out loud under my breath, a sort of mantra:

I am coining a new word in the English language because it is a word that we need to have.

[word]: the feeling of discovering that an ex-mate of yours first established a relationship with their next partner via something they first discovered through you.

ex.: a woman introduces her boyfriend to Bruce Haack's Electronic Record for Children in the course of their relationship, and then later, eight months after they've broken up, happens across the LiveJournal of her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend and discovers that she first started talking to him when she became excited that he put that record on at a party.

I am not very interested in masculine leadership (I am not that interested in leadership at all but masculine leadership is particularly dull), and I really don't like the dynamic of injecting it into the essential order that exists in the cosmos. The idea of a male God continually impregnating the necessarily female World, while understandable, is seriously unfortunate and even disgusting. It's like the height of profanity in the most sacred place possible. I can understand people intuitively jumping to that conclusion but why we would ever want to hold on to it is just baffling to me. It puts everyone in a bad place.

one moment, when liz was lying partway under the couch and I was balancing upside-down doing a handstand on the back of it, when I slid down and lay beside her and she shook her head and said it didn't make sense; she wouldn't tell me what didn't and I said I had my suspicions but neither of us would give unless the other would too, and as I read and she got ready for class she said I didn't have to tell her but she would just be terribly disappointed all day, and I said that I didn't want to put words in her mouth, and she finally said she'd tell me if I told her, and I waited for a minute or two and then said that I thought at that moment she probably thought that it didn't make sense how much I cared about her, and she said that was it, that I was right, and kissed me, and whispered i love you through a crack in the door as she left

Checkers has been solved by computing. Some experts have raised the possibility of solving chess, and the general consensus seems to be that with a sufficiently powerful computer it could be done. If a pursuit as artistic and intuitive as chess was be able to be "perfected" through computing, one wonders if, in time, neuro- and computer science could work together to solve music for any given person's brain. Upon hearing their perfect piece, I wonder if someone would feel so elated as to abandon their heavy worries or so crushed at the confrontation that they would despair and wish to die, and I imagine it depends wholly on basic outlook.

standing on a beach, very cold outside and ethereally windy (the wind always comes towards me from the front and does not seem to have travelled over the ocean; it is sort of two-dimensional, as this vision is in general, though not really two dimensional--it has some characteristics of two-dimensional space and some characteristics of three-dimensional space), sand is perfectly black with large grains, there is a void behind me, sand, water, and sky stretch on infinitely perpendicular to me, it is the blackest night, and the water is fairly translucent, so that it appears to be almost black too but also gains some luminescence from the starlight, which is very bright because the sky is covered in impossibly bright pale cold blue stars; as the piece progresses the procession of the equinoxes takes place right in front of my eyes--I can see a huge frame stretching half-transparent across the sky and turning, and can also see at the same time (in a way that is physically, dimensionally impossible, because it is a sight of things moving like the stars and the frame that are at the same time perfectly still, and also the frame moving is not exactly the same frame as stretches across the sky but at the same time is, or together they form a single unified object, but in any case this form of sight is of course extremely easily and naturally done in that space) the progression through the ages as the stars twist and rotate and the frame moves so that the galactic road opens and closes, and the ages start and end with the start and end of each phasing section in the piece; sometimes, as I settle into the vision, the zodiac sign associated with the age will flash on the sky, in a different position each time, performing a different action, as a still, glowing picture the same color as the stars, in sync with some of the musical rhythms, at a very rapid pace, maybe several times a second (as the rhythms occur)

Spit into mixing basin. Destroy the basin using your teeth or some other sharp object, as long as it's less sharp than glass. Harvest my bile, son. Pour it into the mixing basin and crush for twelve fucking billion seconds, you fuckhead. Then, re-destroy the basin. Now you have a bunch of basin bits. Add the flower salt and any other spare objects you find lying around your dark, dark chamber. By the way, son, don't forget to speak to Gary. Sleep at an advisable time. Pile up the removed crates and thresh them, along with anything else you've been wanting to thresh. Then you're pretty much done, so admire your hard work and sink in. See you soon, son.

This is a podcast that attempts to capture the essence of a comet. It burns very bright.

I feel I am reborn in some twisted form in which I am encountering everything anew and it is awful and terrifying. I fear I'll explode, my heart and liver my abode will receive written from my story on its walls as if hepatoscopially scrying. [And then I feel like dying (if Lil Wayne was Pliny, and I were he).]

Your wonder in verse I cannot address,

for at it you would be incredulous.

For you to shine more bright in these contents

than unswept stone would disturb your self-sense,

so you'd toss them out your interior,

feeling yourself to them inferior.

A rose's eyes, face-set, see just its thorns;

its face, unseen, it too by proxy scorns.

I spoke then a while to Emanuel,

who in Finland's name, now rallying, calls

against you, as breaker of Finnish bonds.

But his stigmata appeared painted on,

a mere mimesis of those of the lore,

so I was made doubtful, and furthermore

the categorical imperative

would make him wrong, and allow you to live.

Then again, I remain in damnation;

he might speak as the son of Creation.

The waxwing loves the false azure he sees

reflected in the windowpane, and flees

his present circumstances to meet her,

as Graves runs pen-wards, meeting Demeter.

At the moment of their union he's surprised;

striking the window, dismembered, he dies.

I feel I'm now his fluff smudge that persists

gone forth, in the reflected sky, to list

to my own teachings, while from all around:

mourning; I fall a little further down.

These poems came running out of me in a few short days. Now they are all blinking at the oppressive bright light, wet with slimy blood, trying immediately to stand on all fours for the first time. I for one am fine, but I hope they themselves do not regret the first steps they are about to take, as hordes of other sprawling millions do swearing at ruined leather shoes and year-long droughts

make a poem from a fake english version of one of silliman's or someone!

A single word puts out a very loud, intense signal. Adding further words complicates the signal while decreasing its volume. However, the volume a single word possesses gives it a different kind of complexity by bringing all of its aspects vividly into play at once. When you look at a whole city, you get a kind of general city essence, but isolating a part of that city might give you a museum, or a theatre, a fight, an orgy, a pound of swans. I am interested in poems that give a rich and detailed signal by collecting enough elements to paint an extremely specific picture but not so many that something like a "general poetic essence" forms instead. I would like people to read my poems not as vague mists of poeticism but precise distillates of a heavily strategic collection of natural elements. I see extremely strong parallels between writing poetry and distilling liquor.

Despite their offensiveness, I adore the Cantos, and I would like to work to channel their passion, not just their complexity.

(liz?) talking about being killed without their knowledge by pills

lead into presentation on 

methylmercury now recognized as one of most dangerous environmental pollutants; symptoms of acute poisoning include peripheral numbness, deafness, dimness of vision, loss of sense of smell, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, restlessness, violent and erratic behavior, and ataxia, progressing to coma and death

Organic mercury compounds including methylmercury produced since 1930; use of mercury in chemical research goes back to 1863; first identified as a health hazard in 1866 when two lab technicians exposed to dimethylmercury died with neurological symptoms 

a series of industrial accidents and cases of poisoning led to a solid understanding of the health effects of m.m. by the 50s, but minamata happened then anyway--we'll explore why

unusual method of poisoning; m.m. distributed in bay by Chisso, who used it in the manufacture of acetaldehyde, and though in low concentrations become concentrated as it moved up the food chain into fish and shellfish and then cats and humans (like other persistent pollutants--DDT, fire retardants. etc.)

first reported on May 1, 1956, when two infants died of an unknown disease with acute mercury poisoning symptoms; had dealt with sporadic cases of a similar disease with abnormal gait, slurred or slow speech, ataxia, deafness, constriction of visual field as main symptoms, erratic emotional reactions (euphoria/depression), bad cases displayed confusion, drowsiness, stupor, or restlessness, shouting, and violent outbursts, which led into coma and death

after official report made by the doctor who treated these patients, a comittee was formed to evaluate the disease, and performed an epidemiological study related to what at the time was known as the "mysterious disease" or "cat-dancing disease" studying those affected and a control group of those from the neighborhood not affected--found to occur regardless of age, family clustering observed but no proof of infectious transfer, wells found to not be involved, ninety percent of housholds were fishermen's or related to fishery, less than 30% in the control group formed from households in the neighborhood, over 2/3rds consumed bay fish daily in substantial amounts while in control only 6% ate local fish daily and in smaller amounts death of cats higher in victims' households than in control group--clearly indicate toxic agent in fish; committee suggested ban on catching an selling of fish from the bay, but the local government was opposed

mercury suspected as cause in '57, but because it was expensive, the scientist that suspected it concluded that it would not be dumped and didn't investigate further; another scientist suspected mercury in '58 and did urine tests and autopsies on victims that showed high concentrations of mercury and also sediment tests showing elevated levels around factory; results reported to committee in 1959 and concluded that mercury in fish and shellfish was the most likely cause; however, arguments over the causal agent persisted for several years, because the causal agent identified linked legal responsibility with Chisso and it was undesirable to damage the reputation or functioning of Chisso due to a sense of loyalty and fealty felt towards the company; also, the procedures to isolate methylmercury and the mechanism by which it is synthesized were not fully understood until 1964

problems? not going public with information meant they were working in a vacuum; had they had the collaboration of other chemists the problem might have been identified much faster and the chemistry necessary to isolate and understand the synthesis of methylmercury might have come about faster. in epidemiology, much easier to identify the source of a cause than to identify the cause itself; when this was done, the local authorities should have immediately banned the consumption of fish, but because the city was used to relying on the bay for food and the economic factors present in preventing the consumption of fish from the bay were worrisome, they didn't; finally, the pervasive sense of loyalty to Chisso and a lack of desire to harm them prevented the science from being productive until long after conclusive results were reached

presentation notes:

endangered species are species that are classified as being threatened with extinction; the Endangered Species Act of 1973 exists here to classify species as such to facilitate their recovery; other countries have similar laws

gov. required to develop recovery plans for all species listed on the act unless it is determined that such a plan will not help to save the species

dismal success; out of over 1200 species on the ESA as of March 2001, only six US-listed species have recovered sufficiently to warrant removal from the list; this is considered due to several factors; more on that later

species are threatened by the following pressures:

resource use (timber, ore, oil, fishing and hunting, etc.)

exotic (non-native) species (competition, predation, parasitism, habitat modification, etc.)

construction (commercial, urban/suburban, rural, roads, etc.)

altered habitat dynamics (successional change, fire regimes, agricultural regimes, etc.)

agriculture

species interactions (non-exotic)

water diversions (dams, irrigation, flood ontrol, etc.)

other factors such as inbreeding, climate change, weather extremes, and catastrophic disasters

worst problems are resource use (80% of end/threat spec affected), exotic species pressure (73%), construction (71%), and altered habitat dynamics (70%), all generally human-caused pressures

plans take into account habitat, population biology, life history, species genetics, behavior, and the general ecology of the area, the factors threatening the species, what management actions to take (population management--translocation, captive breeding, predator control, habitat management--restoration of habitat quality, aquisition of habitat, management/incentive programs--USDA wetlands reserve program, habitat conversation plans), monitoring actions (monitoring focal species, monitoring associated species, monitoring habitat quality), public awareness (raising awareness, enforcing legal protections), and recovery criteria

plans have been largely unsuccessful due to the following problems: funding is very limited and frequently not budgeted out for the scope of the entire project (often just for 3-5 yrs., when recovery efforts usually take longer), monitoring efforts are often misguided (focal species is centered on at the cost of ignoring associated species) and subject to taxonomic bias (birds, mammals), birds and mammals are generally focused on to a greater extent than other species, among other factors

successful efforts usually are focused on a single species with a well-understood and straightforward problem affecting them (bald eagles, peregrine falcons & DDT, gray wolves in yellowstone w/ removal of hunting and trapping pressures); plans taking into account multiple species or with problems that are more complicated rarely succeed

if it were possible to remove human pressures entirely on threatened species, it is likely they would do better (chernobyl example--przewalski's [shevalski] horse), but this is often difficult or impossible (chernobyl impossible for most to inhabit, but most areas are vulnerable to people in spite of laws)

given this, should we be saving species? want to in order to preserve biodiversity, get useful information (medicine, engineering, etc.) from species, etc., but also can't stop changing ecosystem, very difficult to do--should we be focusing our resources elsewhere?

PRICE COPTER

Although it appears true that the social standing of the obviously physically female against the standing of the obviously physical male has evened heavily in the last hundred years or so, there seems to persist an intense bias against femininity as a set of traits or a way of being, a bias that is perhaps at least as strong now as it ever has been. This bias has become more covert in the present era, perhaps, but it seems to have become such because it is enacted largely by rote, out of unconscious habit, as opposed to becoming more covert because it is under mainstream attack.

Much of the work we have done towards establishing gender equality throughout the twentieth century and into the present seems to have been work to grant women traditionally masculine power. We have struggled to allow women to be strong, assertive, to lead and take charge, to be working people, to be independent. This struggle is obviously not over; though significant progress has been made we still have not had a female president, the vast majority of business executives, politicians, people in positions of academic power, and so on remain male, women are discriminated against in politics and work, and so on. However, it is a fight we are well aware of, and little attention seems to have been given to help privilege femininity, to recognize feminine modes of being with masculine ones as equally worthy of human life on their own terms. 

Femininity seems still to be rendered dismally second-class in comparison to masculinity. Furthermore, little work seems to have been done to liberate abstract femininity from physical femininity as we have worked towards with masculinity; we seem to tie the genuine expression of feminine traits far more heavily to the female body than the expression of male traits. And, though we recognize those feminine traits as largely positive, we value them less than those masculine traits almost universally, and in this way our society is still rabidly patriarchal.

enjoyed this

 found the process a gratifying creative outlet

 enjoyed the manner in which the rehearsal process was a continual (re)discovery

 

i thought the theatre games were very enriching and helped the process; I was a bit dubious at first, but they greatly helped us solidify as a group and become comfortable working together

though we worked hard and met often, I frequently thought of this as a kind of respite or relief from the stress of my normal life. I liken it to free trial in that respect, in that, though it took much effort, it was pleasantly expended.

I appreciated the creativity encouraged in the exercises we did (improv games, our highly modulatory take on zip-zap-boing, creating campus spaces out of furniture, etc.), as they made it much easier to create my portion of the parade when the time came, having grown used to the context in which creative activity occurred within the group, and various ways in which it worked and didn't work.

it was nice to have most of our productive activity take place in rehearsals; though we did do work outside of them, it frequently seemed that the ideas we concocted on our own didn't really come to life until we introduced them to the rest of the group. I really liked this highly collaborative atmosphere, as I often find it difficult to really nail down my ideas in a vacuum.

I appreciated how due to our lighthearted approach we could address political and social issues on campus that had very serious connotations for a lot of people with a casual and easygoing touch and still do justice to the issues at stake and our feelings about them. Had we been overly serious or didactic, I do not think our commentary would have been effective; as it was, its lack of weight in presentation seemed to lend it weight when received. 

These fit pretty well:

Tasks seem overwhelming so it's futile to even try.

These procrastination styles can overlap in one of four themes:

Self-Doubt - These people feel there are rigid standards about how thing ought to be done and they fear they will fail. They second-guess themselves and delay taking action.

Discomfort Dodging - This person avoids activities that will cause them distress, discomfort or anxiety. Rather ironically, the act of dodging the activity doesn't make it go away so tensions mount because of this avoidance.

Guilt-Driven - The person feels guilt over tasks undone, but rather than correct the original lack of action continues to procrastinate in order to not face up to the guilt feelings.

Habitual - The person has procrastinated so many times, it becomes an ingrained response. The person no longer thinks about why they do it, they feel it's just a part of themselves. It becomes an automatic response to say, "This is too hard", "I'm too tired", or to laugh it off as a character flaw.

I self-doubt heavily, find my homework causes me discomfort and avoid it (which does not really make me feel better), feel guilty about not doing my work which drives me to avoid it more, and procrastinate habitually

schedules and being organized does not seem to help me; I've tried doing this multiple times but I never stick to my schedule (my emotional reactions to the tasks I have to do don't change) and end up procrastinating even more by trying to put one together

doing things bit-by-bit seems like it would help in theory, but in practice structuring my tasks in this way does not make me feel any different about them and even when I've felt optimistic about this strategy and been convinced it will work, I've still avoided my tasks when the time came to actually do them, even in small, non-intimidating chunks

the same goes for "just doing it"; usually, I want to stop procrastinating and start whatever task I need to desperately, but every time I try to force myself to stop procrastinating and start working, I feel a very strong compulsion coming up from below telling me to do something else that I ultimately find myself unable to resist

starting my tasks early or on time, when I manage to do this, weirdly does not seem to help; my work somehow (I really do not understand this part yet at all) takes endlessly long and I still find myself doing a lot of it at the last minute (what the fuck is up with this?!)

the emotions I associate with this cycle are: anxiety, frustration, and despair/depression

it damages my self-esteem and greatly reduces my quality of life

it also makes it hard for me to function as a student and "live up to my full potential"

I usually find myself researching "overcoming procrastination" strategies when I'm already into deep shit, finding some strategies (like this (10+2)*5 thing or the self-aggrandizement kick-start strategy) that seem like a good idea but aren't usable at this point because I'm past being able to use strategies designed for a whole week, day, or afternoon, and then later when I am at the beginning of the cycle I do remember them but don't seem to be able to get myself to use any of them because they would constitute starting on my work, even though they would constitute starting in a small and theoretically non-off-putting manner

by interacting with the land in a manner departed from their normal person--in which, as opposed to struggling with and against the land as a person, one perceives themselves as giving power to the land over them--one gains new capabilities and new knowledge. hence, rite of passage, rising to status of medicine man, etc.

one becomes a "person of nature," with special ability to understand and influence natural events; one gains new powers by doing so

I think that what makes adulthood worthwhile, at least for me, is the massive increase not only in your independence but also in the scope that you are able to view the world in as you move out of childhood through adolescence and into adulthood. When I was a kid, I thought the world was terribly lacking in richness, and spent much of my time far off in elaborate fantasies; I described myself as an escapist at nine and regularly wished I could find some portal or hidden passageway or something of that sort into another universe that had more to offer. As I grew older, and was able to roam more rangily, I began to have experiences that held the kind of fascination, magnitude, and grandeur that I had longed for and been unable to find as a child. I also found that the increase in introspective capacity allowed me to solve notable problems of mine and notice ones I was previously unaware of. Both of these continue to get more and more true the older I get, so that each year I have thought I was better off than in the last one, even in years when I was relatively unhappy on the whole.

Oh man, okay, I'll define those terms with more rigor. I'm sorry I frustrated you--if this stuff doesn't really interest you, also, I'm happy to stop. I know I sort of came out of nowhere--this just seemed like a fun discussion to have.

When I say "visceral," I mean "purely emotional" as opposed to like "emotional and intellectual." I think sometimes when we first listen to a piece, we get the sense that we don't really "know what it's doing" but we maybe really, really dig it--like we'd be hard-pressed to explain much about its structure or techniques or whatever but we can say stuff like "It was really fast-paced and energetic, and the melody was really pretty." When you listen to it more, you start to notice more technical stuff. You might realize there's a really cool drum fill in the middle of one of the verses, or that there's a subtle key change. In intricate music you might start to pick out variations of a motive or an interesting harmonic progression or something. If you keep listening with the intention to try to follow the piece as well as possible, eventually you can consciously hear all the moments of the piece--they don't just run together into a wash of emotional color without fine details like they may do on first listen. I'm not saying everyone absolutely will always have this experience, but I think anyone that's into music is at least capable of it, and I've never talked to anyone who's listened to a strong piece that way and felt they enjoyed it less after a lot of close listening or that they felt it wasn't music for them anymore. I dunno, we might have different but equally legitimate ideas about what makes something more or less like music, I guess.

perfect

two parts of ritual action are...

related by:

rhythmic similarities both in the top and bottom voices (same figure in the bass, sixteenth-note motion adds cohesion)

second scale's notes are almost entirely placed a half-step away from their equivalents in the first

bass is enharmonically same moved an octave up (later minor second is added)

unrelated by:

difference in scale material

two parts of symphonies are...

related by:

steady pulse (though there is a pulse shift)

common tones

cellular elements

unrelated by:

harmonic difference/scale material

pulse shift

both are related by:

maintenance of common tones throughout both sections despite shifts in scale material

several interlocking but clearly disparate parts on top of each other, especially in the first section (some voices drop out in the second before re-entering with new material)

second section has more energy than the first//moves at a quicker/more consistent pace

similar cellular logic

differences:

symphonies is more condensed than the rite

symphonies has a more radical departure from the first part in the second (especially rhythmically, but also harmonically/melodically)

symphonies has more harmonic coherence within parts (perhaps due to the reduced textural resources)

rite of spring/symphonies outline

thesis: The 

Rite of Spring

 and 

Symphonies of Wind Instruments

 follow a similar compositional method, utilizing many of the same techniques of harmonic and rhythmic shift as well as a similar sort of cellular logic, but are differentiated primarily by their respective lengths and differences in instrumentation; 

Symphonies

, being a leaner, shorter work, as well as one composed several years after the 

Rite

, is more condensed and radical, with shorter maintenance of distinct moments and more severe contrast between them, although sometimes it has a higher degree of textural and part coherence within moments than the 

Rite

, likely due to the lessened availability of distinct colors in 

Symphonies

 by comparison.

I. Introduction

A. 

Rite

 and 

Symphonies

 both seminal Strav. works that reveal his unique compositional genius

B. However, though they follow a similar logic, there are important differences between them and examination of them through comparison can throw Strav.'s technique into sharper relief and lend us insight into his overarching technical principles

C. Thesis

II. Examination of 

Symphonies

A. Harmonic/scalar material; use of Kramer reduction; discussion of harmonic shifts from first to second part with maintenance of important common tones

B. Rhythmic material; variance between first and second sections in terms of pulse shift but cohesion in terms of similar cellular rhythmic figures and sense of constant pulse

C. Significant differences between parts--shifts in several elements--but enough similarity to maintain sense of continuity

III. Examination of 

Rite

A. Harmonic/scalar material: second scale's notes mostly close displacements of the first with maintenance of two common tones (D and F, emphasis on D); arguments for D as central (bottom of bass, only tone maintained except for its third which is not given anywhere near as much prominence, etc.), discussion of dissimilar elements (arguably polytonal activity in the treble staff with C and Eb only in first part, afterwards those tones abandoned, different notes emphasized in treble in second part)

B. Rhythmic material: shift from eighth-note to sixteenth-note pulse; building of more complex texture in second part; constant bass rhythm throughout providing strong cohesion; sixteenth-note figures in first part anticipate constant sixteenth-note pulse in second

C. Possible discussion of cellular analysis?--could talk about cellular manipulation of figures above bass in first section under constant bass pulse which

 Symphonies 

never has in as much a non-cellular fashion as the 

Rite

; bass cells only manipulated and transformed over a much larger space throughout the whole moment

D. Difference in parts noticeable--especially in harmonic and textural areas--but more cohesion than 

Symphonies

; constant bass figure, less rhythmic variance

IV. Synthesis

A. Similarities: maintenance of common tones throughout; several interlocking but disparate stacked parts, especially in first sections; second section more energetic than the first, provides a means of moving away/forward, and develops some ideas stated in the first; similarities in cellular logic

B. Differences; 

Symphonies

 more condensed and techniques more radically executed than in 

Rite

, evident in more radical differences between two parts; 

Symphonies

 has greater levels of harmonic coherence within parts, perhaps due to aforementioned textural limitations; 

Symphonies

 is entirely cellular on a small and very visible scale, while 

Rite

 is less cellular, at least explicitly so, as can be seen in the very slowly developed bass figure

V. Conclusion? (if there is anything else to say)

A. Both pieces follow a unique logic that, though it may be more accessible than, say, Webern, are incredibly radical and established new ways of thinking about composition; the blending of highly disparate and compartmentalized ideas into a cohesive whole on all levels is flawlessly executed and brilliant, as is Strav.'s use of heavy levels of dissonance without necessarily sounding grating, harsh, or very explicitly so unless it is clearly intended; 

Symphonies

 offers the more explicit demonstration of his unique compositional techniques but both are naturally timeless and brilliant

one of the world's most melancholy feelings comes from realizing that something you are doing would thrill you if you saw someone else doing it, but no one around seems particularly moved

I am sad because of people I have forgotten

everything fell apart in circular repeating patterns

things began moving in directions

things began predominantly moving west

caught in westward movement--hard to talk about because brain was in the movement line

some things began moving east

then the nuclear carrots appeared

nuclear carrots glowed and were really radioactive metal bars but I was safe from them

they moved mostly westward although sometimes they sort of disintegrated in lines and parts of them moved eastward

a beautiful red sea formed around their perimeter and then they opened a part of themselves sort of like an eye that held a spinning, shimmering, glowing orb within it that was a deep part of their interior or perhaps their essence; this was an incredibly sweet and touching gesture (thank you carrots!)

then they merged together and fell apart in the midst of this, and I understood why I had kept thinking about sacrifice before; I was all the more touched

then they suddenly came back together and repeated this process several times, like they meant to send me a message in that way

then parts of them moved westward and eastward and things sort of calmed down and then my trip slowly came to a halt

as I listened to "Sawdust and Diamonds" the kitchen window became a sheet of water that droplets of (rain?)water fell through horizontally until they fell in such a volume that the sheet became "full" and slowly denser and denser until it became glass, and then the droplets of water fell through the glass, shattering it every time they fell through, until they formed a "pool" of water in a column horizontally across the boundary between the kitchen and living room in a rectangle the shape of the outermost edge of the window and then slowly that pool became denser and denser until it coalesced into a gigantic pollen grain right across from me next to the piano about the size of a large beach ball which emitted tiny flowers that formed a spiraling circular fractal behind it as the song ended

she had long, crow-black, shiny-black, perfectly straight hair. steve always said she looked like she could be on the cover of Super Fruits 

, if she was Japanese and not from Massachusetts. 

She saw a billboard for a hair removal salon displaying a triangle of thick, curly, cartoon pubic hair, informing her that they could help her boyfriend "find his way."

My boyfriend doesn't need a cosmetologist to help him find my fucking vagina, she thought. Wait, hold on--I can't let a billboard get to me. What if I end up going there?

"The world is a weird-as-shit place," said Steve.

"Yeah," said Ashley. She sipped her coffee.

It's like thoughtcrime, she thought. Thought&collaboration. With capitalism. Capitalist forces. It's sinful.

Wait--I don't believe in sin. I actively do not believe in sin or anything like sin. I think anything I want is permissible. I shouldn't be so hard on myself--maybe it would be nice to have that done by someone else, she thought. Maybe--wait--fuck! She scrunched up her face and made a fist.

"You feeling all right?" asked Morgan.

"Uhhh--" she blinked a few times. "Sure, yeah, what's up?"

"You're&kinda quiet, that's all."

"Oh, sorry," she said.

"No, it's cool, don't worry about it. Stuff like that doesn't get to me. I think it's cool when people feel comfortable around each other, to have, like, moments of silence, y'know?" Steve waved his hand, feeling he dismissed any wrongs she may have committed by him, ever. "I just wanted to make sure you were feeling okay."

"Yeah, sure, I'm fine," said Ashley.

I shouldn't go 'cause it's a waste of money. Jesus. Morality doesn't need to weigh in on either side.

<morgan=steve>

<they decide to get ice cream from a new stand>

<steve works in a museum with extrareal properties>

<ashely doesn't enjoy sex very much physically, but does heavily on a vicarious level; steve seems to revere her and though this makes her uncomfortable she is fulfilled by his happiness, although it seems somewhat alien>

<in museum she feels what it is like to be a seashell, drifts of waves, imagines venus might be standing on top of her; maybe a seashell was not aware of such things, would've missed the whole glory of the Birth>

<steve gets sick, ashley takes care of him>

<one of their friends: "that is one of my favorite memories in the whole of creation. you can take me to the slaughterhouse if I forget it," he said. "to wait with the lambs."

"you're such a romantic, I can't believe you" says his gf

"yes," said Ashley, grinning impishly. "he balances on a wishing well that all men call the world."

I retreat into the bathroom to wash my hands and in the grimy mirror I see a chaste woman, in white, a flowing robe, silver armor, Joan of Arc perhaps or one like her. But looking at her face I see it is truly the face of the Monk.

A beautiful chaste sort of woman, a Gibson Girl, a small opera singer.

"I remember my place in the Order," I say into the mirror, and splash my face, dotting the water from my collar with a paper towel, I am back in the restaurant, they are still at soup--I toss cash on my table and leave at once, acrid city smell, burnt gasoline and dog's fur, the fur of a rotting cur, the alley type. Chinese merchant in a flickering film tosses this dog cart scraps. Smell of cooking cart meat, sweet meat. Dog decomposes, writhing white maggots where the dog was before, white maggots in the shape of a dog, maggots the dog's lapping tongue, the dog's eyes, maggoty dog heart, filthy rotten dog cock, the maggots move in concert, the dog speaks

Students for the Improvement of Graffiti Marring our Aquambrium

Not too long ago, deep in the bowels of our beloved library, lay a remarkable shrine to Rocker brilliance. The library bathroom stall of these bygone days was decked chock-a-block with the most incredible graffiti to be found the world over--post-Marxist pterodactyl illustrations, Arabic banter, and a corner dedicated to branching food worldplay were just a few of the fantastic creations that roamed upon the white fields of the stall walls. The periodic whitewashing that erased it all brought only momentary wistfulness as it made way for a new and clever menagerie of wonder.

Sadly, the stall has lost much of its former brilliance as of late. These days, simply writing "dicks lol" seems to pass as a top-notch witticism. I've tried to do my part--modifying "BigAssesRoundTits.com" to read "BigAssetsRoundTithes.com: A Lazarus Loafer Blog," drawing a Cardiacs daisy, and such--but no one can conquer this onslaught of dialogorrhoea alone. 

You, too, must play your hand!

This group is a call to action. We all are clever folks, and if we work together we can usher in a new era of bathroom brilliance. The fruits of our labor will be a remarkable stall-a'-glory to the dangers of creative complacence and the power of the collective Rocker spirit. All we must do is ensure that every time we use that stall, we add at least one cunning quip, distinguished drawing, or improvement of an insidious illustration--and, soon, victory will be ours.

So go forth, pen in hand, and revitalize--renew--recreate! Make every shit a gift!

nocturnal sounds (the awakening)

the wayward

 During the first two years of college I was often tremendously optimistic. The school I went to--Simon's Rock--is an alternate universe where everything is usually glittery and very, very fast. Sometimes you are part of the glitter and you glitter yourself and other times you are thrown about in the glitter and the glitter cuts you. But the glitter is always there. Once I glittered so much that I nearly shot right up to Heaven with so much force as to give all the folks up there a really heavy start when I broke through. Three months later I got cut so bad I nearly died, lying there bleeding out on a cold dark hill near the Fischer Science Center. That's just the way things are there.

 There's a saying about Rockers that goes if you put two of 'em in a room they will find each other, even if the room is the size of a colosseum and filled floor to ceiling with writhing, screaming, starving prisoners. The same saying goes on to talk about how once you have gone to the Rock your life will never follow any likely pattern. This is due to an unusual field that surrounds Rockers. It is a Field of Improbability. On the Rock campus the Field is very powerful which is what produces the alternate universe characteristics of the Rock. The Field has caused the Rock to tunnel through the standard universe and flesh out its own pocket.

 When you are at the Rock clocks don't run proper. The clock tower rings whenever it likes and however many times it feels would be unnerving. The right book appears in your hand suddenly and ties you down for hours. Cooked mushrooms appear in the air and similarly stop your progress. People go insane and then ascend out of space permanently. Turkeys just float upwards by default. You cannot predict or understand distance. You just try to get by the best you can and roll with it whenever possible.

 

Hullo! I'm also a graduate (one-and-a-half years) so similarly my opinions may be out-of-date.

1. It really depends on who you fall in with. It's maybe cliquier--or at least more socially fractured--than some other liberal arts schools simply because it attracts a really wide gamut of folks, some of whom probably wouldn't have gone to a liberal arts school otherwise. That said, it's not really like people are necessarily snotty or exclusive in a public way, just that people tend to hang out with other people with whom they have stuff in common and may end up feeling like the other people on campus they don't hang out with are too different from them for them to connect with much socially. Or not--but that definitely seems to me to be a more common feeling at the Rock than is maybe average for small liberal arts schools. Sometimes social groups form that decide that they really actively hate most people who aren't in them, but they don't necessarily go around being that way at other people, and they may be almost invisible or at least harmlessly or even entertainingly inscrutable to you if you're not part of them. 

A lot of people socialize by just sort of hanging out and talking in groups in a living room or whatnot, although some folks also like party party, sort of--but generally, again, I think parties at the Rock tend to be more low-key than they might be at other similar schools. People are often into heavy conversation more than anything else as a way to socialize, in large groups or otherwise (and "large" is fairly relative to the size of the school--anything over five or so people can feel pretty large). The campus is usually pretty quiet, more or less. That said, the smallness of campus makes it easy to hang out with people almost constantly if you want to. Most things happen spontaneously and in private.

As a side note, everyone seems to have at least a slightly different opinion about this, so I'd take anything anyone says with a certain grain of salt--it was probably true for them, and you'll probably find people on campus for whom whatever they said seems to be true, but it may not be true for you, in the long run, if you do go. You'll really notice this as a prospie if you ask a lot of different people what the average Rocker is like--everyone has a really specific idea about it and no two people's are the same.

2. I second Dan totally. It's not an easy school and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to go to an easy school. That said, although you can definitely set up your academic life so you have time to do almost nothing but work, you can also probably set it up so that you can get your work done and still have a comfortable amount of free time. This can be sort of an art, depending on who you are and what you want, but you'll probably figure it out if you do decide to go. Also, it's generally difficult because the work you're being asked to do requires a lot of thought and the standards are high, not because you're just given a meaninglessly gigantic workload, which is really nice if that's what you like in academics.

I'd also say that it's not really worth worrying about too much in advance, aside from knowing that the academics are challenging and high-quality and deciding whether or not that appeals to you, simply because it's really hard to predict how your academic experience in high school will map onto your academic experience at the Rock (or probably any college, really). There are people who pull straight As in high school who fail out of the Rock, and people who barely scrape by in high school only to graduate from the Rock with high honors. There are also people who do well or not well in both. There's even a lot of variance between the academic tone of the Rock and other colleges--there's a well-founded stereotype about Rockers transferring to other schools and then transferring back to the Rock complaining that the academics wherever they went were unsatisfying, but I've also talked to former Rockers who felt unfulfilled at the Rock after a couple years, transferred away, and were much happier at the school they transferred to. It goes on forever.

3. You can go to another school after your freshman year, and usually a few people do this every year in some way or another. Everything that Dan said is definitely worth considering--often, common or even universal classes for freshman, like Freshman Seminar, don't fit easily or anywhere into the course structures that other schools have, making it hard to get enough transfer credits to enter somewhere as a sophomore, even if you can transfer. If you do well academically as a freshman and are content entering another college as a freshman afterwards, though, odds are pretty good that wherever you want to go will accept you, I think. In this way, going to the Rock can be a good way to get out of high school even if you don't stay. The Rock will almost certainly have you back if you decide you don't like wherever you transferred and want to return, too, although you might run into financial aid trouble (probably not worth worrying about this sort of thing at all where you are right now, though).

4. Yeah--sometimes too much, even, I think.

Good luck, in whatever you decide to do!

At first, I penned a Japanese haiku, recalling the great deal of time we spent in this medium in middle school:

However, thinking that might be 

too

 short, I also composed an iambic-pentametered sonnet, again recalling a middle school memory in which we wrote one together in response to Tom's challenge of anyone in the class to do so:

you are so absent(ee)

soft penis flesh feels just like smooth dough

Like a solvent or an acid, I was exposed to Mary's Room about six months ago and began to "go to work" on it. At this point a solution has formed.

Variance Elegy

Through an intangible hull:

a quiet imprint of long-dead furor 

where looming spirits of iron and wood

hang like abandoned husks of a cicadian empire;

a softly glowing field of diaphanous moisture

bathes them in unceasing embrace

and Ozymandias strides, hulking, silent and unseen

between each empyrean edifice--

every bead of soot and soil has its place

in still, crystalline concert with all other matter

in this space apart;

looking out across the nighted fields

one tastes like ozone the tension

in the limitless gulf between every atom and the self,

each sinew unsolvably separate

from the Elysian expanse;

and yet every darkened board

lining the womb of each soaring tower,

each blade of grass standing rank and file--

an army of ghosts in quiet defiance--

shouts into the infinite space between them and flesh

and speaks an invitation:

all it would take is one whisper of the will

to pass through that sole barrier

and emerge incorporeal.

So, like, I'm Jewish, right? Okay, so I'm walking down the street and I see a bakery, and I'm like, "What's up with that?"

closer: So, like, why do they call 'em&"cakes?"

pg. 319 -- we see why this is the case; she has been hoodwinked by str.'s preface, and though she addresses in a footnote why this is a bad idea, she does not take her own advice

strindberg outline:

I. Introduction

 A. Str. is frequently viewed as having two identities; a pre-Inferno naturalistic one, and a post-Inferno symbolist one.

 B. While this division is valid, in that Str. did have a radical change both in outlook and art produced, he was never as much as a naturalist as some have suggested.

 C. Str.'s work has been dominated by a marked subjectivity that has made it idiosyncratic; I mean to argue that he was never a "true" naturalist, or if he was, it was a highly unusual one, and that his attraction to naturalism and positioning of himself as one may have been more of a social effort (to attract a wider european audience after his blasphemy trial and court zola whom he admired) than a genuine artistic effort, though he himself did appear to think himself at the heart of naturalism at one point.

II. What is naturalism?

 A. Naturalism appreciates detail for sake of detail (painstakingly constructed sets; pg. 124); wants to study those on the underbelly; believes that people struggle against heritage and environment (pg. 122); wants to portray "everyday life" (pg. 123; brust. 137); means to allow the audience to observe the world "as it really is" (128); advocates new social movements like the liberation of women (br. 138/139/142)

III. Str. is not this

 A. Str. was highly psychologically-focused and subjective; thought less about heredity and environment and more about conflicts of mind and will; interested less in genetics and more in hypnosis and concerned with class mainly as part of his sense of fragmentation and in a way that was caught up with his sexual dilemma (br. 138, 142, 145)

 B. wanted to create a space where unusual or fantastic things from life were displayed (123); utilized a minimal set and wanted audience to imagine the rest (124)

 C. thought of "high" naturalism as this (greater naturalism) but no one else seemed to think of naturalism as being the same thing he did (zola, ibsen)

IV. Miss Julie is not this

 A. concerned with str.'s internal struggle between male/female//father/mother//artiscrat/servant (pg. 142 br.) in an idiosyncratic manner having less to do with the hereditary/environmental fashions of the time and more to do with str.'s unique outlook

 B. jean is emasculated by count for incest (pg. 145 br.); freudian

V. Miss Julie is more like Ghost Sonata

 A. strange concern with filth and debasement of physical reality as impure (julie: 159-160 br., 173 br. -- ghost: 166 br.); split of heaven and earth with death as redeeming; concerned with psychic conflict and involving supernatural will battles (jean v. julie w/ autosuggestion, hummel v. student with weird magic, etc.)

VI. Some people think julie is naturalistic but they are wrong

 A. private parts: hoodwinked by julie preface (318/319)

 b. preface more to please zola and garner euro. fans than anything else (122, 123)

VII. Conclusion

 A. Str. really wasn't very attached to the natural world or reality in any objective sense at all, ever (173); this is actually, in many ways, what makes his drama compelling; it was both the source of his pathos and the source of his genius

THE BOSOM OF YOUR STUPID UNICORN SPIT

I am SAXONY

ultimately everything is relative. when I said life was about tricking yourself I was right. eventually there's a point at which you don't care about anything at all but are cripplingly sad and at that point the only thing to do really is kill yourself. if you care about the people around you then being told people care about you is consolation. if not then there's no reason to bother. it's sort of the same principle with getting help; if nothing makes you happy enough to inspire you to continue living then there's no reason to do that. ultimately that is where I'm at right now. I'm very tired and so I think I'll go to bed but tomorrow at night I'll bundle up some to prevent the risk of frostbite and then cover myself in ice so I'm wet and go to sleep in Siberia. if I do this early enough I ought to have enough time so that I'll die of hypothermia. I would do it right now but I'm so tired and out of sorts that I can't think straight enough to do anything but go to bed and finish this tomorrow. I know technically if I don't care about anything I ought to disregard tiredness and just go and do it and plus if I'm already sleepy even better and so on and so forth but I am not thinking logically right now; my emotions have entirely overpowered my reasonable faculties and thus the latter is hopeless to affect any change in the former. anyway this is an especially good way because I don't risk brain damage if discovered. I don't want to jump in the lake because it has this essence of filth about it to me and I have these issues tying in with OCD about it and don't want to be in it. sleeping in Siberia is nice and peaceful anyway and hours vs. minutes isn't really a big difference anyway especially if I'm asleep.

I'm so sad it's come to this. I didn't want this to happen. I just snapped. Suddenly the thing in me that was reminding me about the unpredictability of the future and how I ought to hope for things to improve and whatnot stopped working. Maybe tomorrow I'll wake up and it'll have come back and I guess I'll be happy about that but if it doesn't I guess I'll take solace in dying. I suppose I have no opinion in this matter. I'm just doing what I feel I have to do. As I said, I'm not thinking in logical terms anymore. I've lost that ability.

watching the system shake

Oh, yeah, I have a narwhale of a time punning it up with my fishy chums--it's buckets of fun! Still, I don't know if this is the proper forum for me to set sail towards Punisia, given its position at the Earth's Tadpoles.

7/16/08 -- A tall man with a bit of stubble in 36 tells me that he thinks the DNC is "the living incarnation of Satan," and that he would "firebomb them" if he could. When I look at you," he says, "I just see a big 666 written right on your forehead."

7/17/08 -- A quivering, ancient woman with large glasses that make her eyes look giant answers the door in a wealthy 36 neighborhood and says she won't support Barack Obama because she's "a Christian lady, and Barack Obama is a Muslim." I tell her that Obama was raised Christian and has been one his whole life, to which she replies, "Well, I know he recently found Christ, but for the longest time he's been a Muslim." I go to correct her again and she says, "I'm a Republican, anyway, so I won't be voting for him regardless."

7/18/08 -- In a low-income neighborhood in 52, I come upon a run-down house with a dilapidated car in the driveway. The car has all its windows open and is blasting mariachi music from its speakers. Figuring the person who owns the house and car might not have a stereo and is inside the house using their car to listen to music, I approach the front door to knock. As I near the stoop, a group of chickens run across it following a rooster and circle around towards the back of the house. After knocking on the door, I receive no response.

Also, an awesome story from this day: I get very few contributions most of the day as many are too poor to give, but at the very last house I knock on the door of, at 8:58, I find a man with a British accent who listens very attentively to my rap, invites me indoors about three quarters of the way through, and says, "I sure hope you're asking for cash, because I can't vote." I tell him that I am, finish off my rap with the bit about the suggested contribution of a hundred dollars, and he says, "Should I give you a hundred dollars? Should I?...Yeah, I'll give you a hundred bucks." After fetching his credit card, he says, "I love your politics in this country. They're fascinating--a total circus show. There's all this money involved--where I'm from, you just pass out a leaflet with what your candidate believes and that's it." Turns out he's German, but lived in Ireland for years and learned to speak English from a British teacher, then moved to the States. Since he only has a green card, not citizenship, he's eligible to contribute to political campaigns but not vote. He tells me a story about how his girlfriend's parents are hardcore right-wingers because they're Christian and believe abortion is wrong, but since they don't support a lot of Bush's other policies, he did all this reading of scripture, "waded through all this bullshit, y'know"--and made a case to them arguing that they should support the Democrats, which he had just recently sold them on and was stoked about. As I leave, he gives me a Tecate for the road. Absolutely coolest canvasee ever.

7/21/08 -- A bearded man playing the bongos with a guitarist friend of his on their porch tells me that he won't contribute because it doesn't matter who gets funding anyway--elections are decided beforehand by a "kaballist, skull-and-bones, illuminatus sect" that John McCain, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and all the rest are part of together. He does concede that McCain is a "lunatic," and that Obama would make a much better president, but is convinced he can make no difference in the election's outcome. According to him, the only politicians who aren't in with the kaballist sect are Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul. Huh.

7/22/08 -- khunya

7/23/08 -- I walk up to a house with a gigantic American flag in the yard--on a real flagpole--to find that not only the yard but in fact the entire house is the most all-American abode ever; the tablecloth appears hand-knit with a pattern of American flags, every room I can see through the window has a painting of the Revolutionary war, and they even have three color-coordinated umbrellas in the living room--one in red, one in white, and one in blue. I am sad they aren't home.

7/24/08 -- It is pouring rain from Hurricane Dolly and thunder and lightning are everywhere. At the beginning of my turf I canvass a guy who invites me into his home, listens attentively to my rap, and then says he'll contribute ten bucks by credit card. As he's filling out the contribution form, he only writes his first name, "Joe," so I tell him that he also has to supply his last name, at which point he writes "Incognito" after it. I assume he's supplied a fake name, but I don't call him on it, figuring I can just check the name on his credit card when he takes it out of his wallet; upon doing so, though, it turns out that his name is, actually, "Joseph D. Incognito, Jr." He also lends me an umbrella.

Upon relating this story to Jordan, my field manager, he concluded that I had won.

 Once long ago, in a faraway land, there lived a hot dog peddler. He would set up on street corners and hawk hot dogs from sunup to sundown. He loved his job and his cart--loved to fill the air around him with the smell of grilled pork from a hot fire, knew intimately the instant satisfaction brought to his customers by his product, had fond feelings for the green umbrella that kept him cool and dry and the untouchable immaculate white of his stand in the midst of a dirty city. 

 Before long he grew old. He went bald and the ring of white hair around his skull grew down past his shoulders. His beard became long and full and white like a tube full of thick fog. His face became leathery and worn-in with deep dimples and lines around the eyes, and he began to kvetch ceaselessly about his arthritic knees and poor heart. Soon he was too weak to operate his stand. It brought him deep sadness to see the stand sitting inanimate on distant street corner. He wanted to hire someone young to tend the stand for him, but he could not, because he was poor.

the one thing it is possible to do to any discrete object is to modify its emotional impact, by making it more intense, melancholy, thrilling, warm, wet, nauseating, ribbed, monacle-related etc. [ oh dear there is a fractal here: each of those emotions has this quality too--oh, because they are also discrete objects--but it keeps going, with a map formed from the patterns of that whole process having its own fractal--a fractal of fractals!--which has its own fractal--it's a true fractal! ]. taking these actions is what an artist does [ traditional forms of art are attempts to capture very specific points on the most basic map inside of an equally specific spot one step up in the fractal, which amounts to a mode, where things such as visual art, music, aromatherapy, etc. reside--literature exists on the next step up in the fractal, as s system of meaning whose shape is dependent on the shape of the dot below it--language--or perhaps on another level up from that--linguistic art ]

At the sea, team of low crest:

City streets! The city bus!

one is known to half of us

as just the vehicle. mundane--

but I saw a searing rain

of light split everything in two

around me there. a pale fire

and the world was half-gone.

together there we sung

an elegy, and it was done.

one moon, and a single sun.

was this

my sacrifice--

the dead diseases

giving rise to a new life?

that old wall I've overgrown--

I've moved into 

my new home.

-------

I am the whale who broke the spirit cord

and by my hand, which penned the first accord--

that each estate is one's own to make--

my last adduction nears the shore, to break.

I am the zeppelin, near and bright

that carved atomic through the night.

That scarred the sand, that bit the air--

now I am a crimson stair.

I am the womb of stars

that, leaving, make birth scars

of absence, leaving none

of me, and so, we're one.

I am the bomb.

I am the war that's won.

Eos!

Was it you who split

the glint of the thought and the sight of the writ?

Eosophia, what a prison, here!

in every object your avatar appears.

Across the lake: a charming house

a solemn promise to block the cold

so onward we head due south

a shattered pass; a broken mold;

this ruinous blank slate!

ruinous!

ruinous!

but what do the crossroads of Macrobius hold?

his mind:

"the price of cotton

he says 

perfect aplomb

Isn't that crazy. You thought you were someone else, but no.

You are standing in the kitchen. You think you want to do your homework, but you're too hungry, although you just ate. There is a fridge and a counter with some bananas on it.

>check fridge

There is a lot of food in the fridge, but somehow none of it is actually edible in its current state. There are a lot of sauces and other things that need to be combined with more substantial foods to make a meal. The only exception are the leftovers from last night's dinner, which you just ate most of and are tired of eating.

>eat banana

You eat a banana. While you are eating the banana you think about fractals and Valium.

>do homework

You go into the living room to do your homework, but it occurs to you that you don't actually want to do it at all. You want to work on a song.

>write song lyrics

You go to write some song lyrics--but wait! Writing song lyrics is difficult, and though the grand satisfaction you will feel when the song is finished will be terribly rewarding, it is not as compelling as the instant joy of reloading the Joanna Newsom "Tadpoles" forum three thousand times.

>god dammit

I don't understand that command.

I'm sorry but I'm not your best friend

all good things must come to an end(?)

can understand why hal says tortuga is better book

sheep follows highly predictable pattern; effective, in giving impression of continuous collapse, but teleological, which human life is not, and thus is ineffective as a human story in comparison to tortuga

however, sheep has great emotional pull and makes its point well--

powerful

 book, in a way that tortuga is not, but tortuga wins out in the end with staying power--like comparing an atom bomb to a plague

both are tales of decay, and in some ways a social decay; their common ground can be found most of all in the manner in which they both chart a deterioration of humanity

a novel like sheep makes you fear for nature at the folly of man, but it takes a novel like tortuga to really make you feel and appreciate them

By th' by, y'all are totes free t' bring guests! Jus' ask me first if it's lots of them, if' y' would, 'cos my apartment is very "cozy" an' if it fills up with Too Many Humans it'll b'come less "cozy" and more like a ""carcass" "freezer.""

I have Tourette's. It manifests mildly in me. The vast majority of my tics are motion-based and though noticeable by others not in an obtrusive manner. Additionally when I am in conversation much of my tic energy is naturally channeled into conversational gestures which makes me seem animate but not off-puttingly bizarre. I do have verbal tics but only when I am ticcing hard, and they are never swears or anything obtrusive to say. Instead they are a particular class of words that appeals to that part of my brain. Like any tic they feel immensely satisfying to mechanically produce. "Partridges." "Tartarus." A particularly frequent one is "whopping tar." I say them not as single phrases but in long, rhythmic patterns where the syllables are broken up into distinct units. "Whop-op-op-op-op-op-whop-whop-whop-whop-whop-whopping tar-whopping tar-tar-tar-tar-tar-tar-whopping tar-tar-tar" I will say very quickly and evenly.

 Usually when I have verbal tics I can say them under my breath or even just form the words with my mouth and I'm satisfied. When I get too high I have to them very loudly and precisely to feel all right. All of my body twitches and undulates in a concert of patterns. My whole brain is so utterly consumed with ticcing that the rest of the world deflects off me--I can barely participate in conversation because things people say to me flicker vaguely at the very edge of my awareness. and my whole brain and body are so occupied that I can't process or respond to anything said to me with anything but terse, short phrases that indicate minimal attention. Normal tic-relieving activities work--singing is a great help, as is dancing, or playing an instrument. In social settings I often read although this is hard--I am so energetic that I can barely take in words and I feel a desperate urge to move the whole time, but it keeps ticcing just barely at bay so I can avoid making a scene.

 This can last for anywhere between two and seven hours, dependent largely on the dose and the method of consumption--I have thrown myself into hideous marathon-length experiences of this nature from eating too much of an edible. I first discovered this on accident because a normal amount of an edible for someone will do this to me. On the other hand I can eat a minuscule amount of an edible and feel wonderful.

 After the tic phase ends I rapidly move into a new phase, so rapidly that it took several experiences of this type for me to even notice the pattern. I begin to get the sense that I am wearing myself out--the heavy tic energy begins to pass out of my body and I have the feeling of coming back to the ground. Within a minute of this realization I get the urge to do something I can sink into. Inevitably this ends up being reading--I will look at some source of printed word within arm's reach, feel the impulse to read it, and immediately descend onto it and read it ravenously, motionless, in a continuous stream. This will maybe go on for one or two hours. I read quickly and sometimes I can chew through most of a book in this time.

 Eventually I will begin to feel my attention wander. I will keep reading but it will occur to me that it might be nice to do something else. Following on the heels of this will be the return of physical awareness--I will suddenly feel myself again. During the reading phase I almost feel like a floating point but I'm so focused on what I'm reading and not on myself that I don't consciously register this sense of disembodiment. I only notice it in retrospect. Now that I've really thought through it I will probably start to notice it as it happens. In any case I will then stop reading and stand up, and it will suddenly occur to me that I am completely down. I feel neutral. I can act of my own will again. The thing has run its course.

air of offices vs. air of outdoors = judicial vs. regular; each is incompatible with the other

elsa, having no knowledge of the trial, is outside it; by submitting to Leni, who exists within the sphere of the court, he fully crosses the boundary between the two worlds, submitting himself to the court as well

"vast judicial organism in a state of eternal equilibrium...after all, everything is connected..."

everything said about this court is simultaneously true

indeed, after his visit with the lawyer, the trial enters all aspects of his life and he is consumed by the court

his work becomes bothersome in the face of the trial; he imagines it is a court device to bother him in allowing him to continue to work; the court continues to infiltrate his entire life

what do children symbolize?

what do paintings of judges symbolize?

nice touch with the "unfinished" dark figure of justice in the painter's portrait--and the combination of justice and victory--"justice ought to remain motionless, otherwise the scales sway"--becomes like the goddess of the hunt!

painter's portrait was intended for a woman; the last time we saw one was in Leni's room

the Law is a psychological construct; josef k. declines on several occasions to leave it alone when presented with the opportunity but instead focuses his attention on it and is further drawn in; furthermore consider the parable of the country man and the gatekeeper

the Law is also an organic deity, a transcendental force; "everyone strives to reach [it]"

one cannot criticize the Law; it is beyond human judgement; one should not consider all the actions and statements the Law requires true or valid, but merely necessary; "lies are made into a universal system"

"a unit of the sort seldom formed by lifeless matter"

people fundamentally define their world via dichotomy and contradiction; a force which defies that is one that transcends human understanding and can rule the world; if we focus only on contradiction without a "higher force" our entire world becomes baseless; 

thus we must trust in something which defies contradiction

; this is a contradiction in terms itself but by accepting that it defies contradiction we submit to it

this book is an implex; the entire point of the novel can be found throughout it; reading the book in its entirety only makes it more clear

josef k. is the king of a year; he is indoctrinated and slaughtered a year later

Gabriellyrics

there was a grey dawn when the first rain fell

fall's beatific spirit down on summer and on hell

our favored clime, thus an Axion, reared its sleet-eyed head to tell

us of the synchron and how all things were well

tabby panther with your claws on,

shatter the panopticon!

we spoke in wonder, shouting, "look at all this money!

four out of five orthodonteries agree

that thus signified the logic of our union's got irrefutability

and it carries with it an all-encompassing levity

look at these things we've illumined; it would be a shame to let them atrophy!"

I've shed enough tears now for all the water in our biodome

made ashen fluff by your window, the reflected sky's my home

driven only by catharsis, that which we hold so dear

ours once to share; now day by day I wait for it to come here 

oh, the lengths I go to from the ivory of my spire

the poem I sent walking past the pylons, winding wires;

"a rose's eyes, face-set, see just its thorns;

its face, unseen, it too by proxy scorns."

our love lies cot-ridden in a graveyard of Mexicans

half-dying, pre-coma, crying, "Does nobody understand?"

may it be a Finnegan, while half-perished on its bed

thanum an Dhul, whiskey: so it rises from the dead!

tabby panther with your claws on,

shatter the panopticon!

o gabrielle!

gabrielle!

gabrielle!

gabrielle!

gabrielle!

every fiber was a fire-crest

every atom was a sea-shoal

and in that nebulous numinousness

I was completed, and shook, celestials

TWO SHORT SHORTS--FROM A DREAM:

1.

a man (at a party in the 50s) wants to see the color "indigo blue," which is a color of such deep blue that it "takes nearly all the color in his mind to produce it"

an old woman at this party has a machine that creates colors by mixing ink and can put a drop of one on a piece of paper

first one she produces for him is "violet blue," a color like if you pushed violet as close to blue as possible, and disgustingly far from what he wants

she is a "regular 50s witch"

[a man at the beginning of the ocean lies on a couch and thinks about math and the ocean (the geometry of the ocean?]? he speaks with the other man who has color desires

2.

a man thinks salt and pepper are magical

he would think they were less so if they just came out of the earth, but because they are produced by people (he thinks), they have a dark and impressive magical air about them

"he took the Amen, which helped him with this line of thought."

&

In my dream, these shorts were in a book of stories by Kafka. I was reading them in the living room of a house sort of like the ones I lived in as a young child that I was in with Damon, my mom and dad, and possibly Shani and John and/or Penny. I got in an argument with Damon, who was making dinner, about whether or not I should come to the table when he suggested I do so, or wait to finish the stories I was reading.

I am, indeed, a sacricolist of the everyday usage of such words, as should be self-evident given my lubency to handle them thus; furthermore, though such speech initially must constitute altiloquence, it facilitates an increase in the noscibility of the words in question and thus serves an aim beyond simple pleasure.

Rudolf Otto, at the beginning of the 20th century, attempted to answer this question. In his book The Idea of the Holy, he coined the term numinous. This what what he meant by it:

I think he was getting close.

Wind Quintet Outline:

Start /w slow, very unified texture--all five winds working in harmony through slow-moving, not-very-rhythmically-oriented progressions

work up to currently written section; have harmonic motion behind repetitive oboe figure, have figure drive momentum forward into main section of piece

in main section, bass. and horn close together; bass. in strong, low range with horn very low adding support and color, playing very rhythmic figures; top three winds function as unit, trading flying melodic material over rhythmic figures

eventually, momentum, after reaching climax, peters down into end section, which is similar to first in unity of texture but has instruments gradually drop out of the fore; perhaps have only two winds eventually left playing a quiet, repeating figure before dropping out slowly and ending the piece

when you lay there (among)

stark and undressed

while the wind whispered its whalesong

while our bed held its breath

The world is constantly presenting you with exactly what you need. I don't mean that in some kind of New Age-y bullshit way. It is several times a week that I take a book I feel attracted to off the shelf, open it to a random page, and find immediately the solution to whatever problem I've been turning over habitually at the time. No doubt some part of me already had all the machinery needed to solve that problem built and just needed some kernel of something that it could use--perhaps the one I found was one of millions that could work. The trick I think is setting up your life so you are constantly handing down those sorts of kernels to the rest of yourself. I get them most often from reading, listening to music, talking to people I get along with, being outside--regular things, it's not really that hard, but if I say spend all day on the general internet I don't seem to get much, unless I'm being really dogged in how I go at it. I try to be really, really there for those things, which maybe is part of it--I just stand there and read, or sit and listen to music--I just sit and stare at the speakers if I'm really going at it--if I'm talking to someone and the conversation's good I forget everything else, I won't eat all day--I try to take immense pleasure in the sensory input I get outdoors, I feel like I'm being caressed--

When you are studying how to fight, you are reliably told to strike "past" whomever you intend to hit--at, say, a point two feet behind them--so that you don't stop yourself short. Try write poems the same way--incidentally, as if they were part of a larger work.

friends

one has a sleep writing blog (like zach's) that he shows to his friends--"hey, guys, look, I can write while I'm asleep" exact same content as Zach's

one of his friends discovers a blog written by a cancer patient /w typical cancer patient content that they interact with in the same way as the sleep blog

one friend, Jeff, sees the blog and laughs for 70 years; he is incapacitated for the entire time

sketch turns into a documentary and retrospective about his life when his comment on the cancer blog is read by him (sad piano, black-and-white images of him in hospital slow-motion fade in and out, etc.)

mother is "interviewed" while dead (pulled out of drawer in morgue, name and dates of birth and death at bottom of screen after a few seconds, after she says first sentence, so viewer is disoriented) "I remember the day Jeff started laughing&I felt like I lost my son&when he came back, it was like I had a son again"

friends discover in the course of the documentary that if they put a laptop in his hands he "writes stuff!" which is a bunch of nonsense produced by his hands flailing on the keyboard, which they decide to post as a blog

his friends are stricken with laughter in the same manner, next shot is of them in hospital

cut to Jeff's mom also laughing dead in morgue

narrator comes in over her chuckling, maybe says one or two words

cuts through panels of laughter (stock footage, celebrities, jesus, presidents [reagan], etc.), sketch gradually devolves

footage becomes spliced in that has little to do with sketch

vaudeville footage slowly becomes prevalent

eventually some of the vaudeville footage turns out to be a vaudeville routine shown for its full length

--END--

farmer-like man dressed in overalls dumps a huge colander full of ravioli into a large blue public mailbox

when the mailman comes to pick up the mail and sees the ravioli, he is overwhelmed and goes to sit on a stump and says, "oh my, that's a lot of ravioli. oh gee. oh gee whilickers. my lord, that's a lot of ravioli." eventually his expressions get more intense: "shoot me in the sternum and name me Sally, that's a lot of ravioli. fuck my eyeballs, Jimmy. slaughter me up a goat; that's a lot of ravioli." at times he takes out a white handkerchief and mops his brow.

--END--

a Japanese family is sitting at the breakfast table, while the mother is in the kitchen making breakfast. her and her husband are both elderly.

an American exchange student come downstairs and walks past the table into the kitchen. he sees the mother and says a halting phrase in Japanese. she replies, and he replies in kind. she gives him a big, warm smile, and then shoves her face in the deep fryer.

a few seconds go by, then the rest of the Japanese family responds with the voices and mannerisms of large black americans: "fuck, man. sheeeiiit. etc."

--END--

a whole episode in which, in real time, the lives of a person or several people are portrayed. they are extremely mundane and nothing notable happens (someone sleeping, an hour at the office, a family at a diner having a nondescript conversation with a lot of pauses, etc.)

--END--

Jim's crab-oriented diner

--END--

defines three variables called drink, lyrics, and cans (two strings, one number) with values "Energy Drink", "", and 99

initiates a while loop that runs as long as cans > 0

 changes lyrics to bottles o' beer with energy drink according to value of cans

 if cans > 1 print apropos lyrics

 at end of loop print end of song

 at end of each loop iteration subtract one from cans

print the value of "lyrics" in the document

(why is the last line outside of the while loop? oh, because passing a string to lyrics doesn't erase the old string--oh, because they wrote the code so it behaves that way--"lyrics + etc.")

Is it worth it to stay alive?

"A Better World"

We see a better world

from the one we're in now

where all of us people

can stand together

And the strength of our feeling

is falling like snow

to blanket the world

for now and forever

We're all shapes and sizes

all colors and nations

the young and the wizened

the rich and the poor

We talk to each other

and we deeply listen

and we'll work hard together

'till our world has arisen

/

We talk to each other

and listen with kindness

and we'll work hard together

'till our world arises

I think the deepest sort of strength is the sort that allows you to expose your most vulnerable places, be attacked in that position, and continue to thrive. The ability to repel people from ever seeing or touching those places seems trifling by comparison. In the interest of developing that strength, which has been small in me, I've decided to write here.

It's interesting to see the differences in how I behave when I give myself a block of free time versus when I'm taking free time while I think I ought to be doing something else. When I give myself free time, I often start by rushing around taking care of all the obligations and tasks and things I need to take care of, so that whatever activity I chose to do I can do without worrying about them. I'm also inclined to pick activities that seem "productive" to me in some way--it's very unlikely that I would decide to just read random articles on my Facebook feed, for example. When I'm taking free time in the midst of an "obligation structure", I act in a much more "id"ish way--I wander Facebook, Twitter, and Wikipedia aimlessly, mostly.

I sort of feel like it's hard for me to properly relax when I give myself free time--my superego is very present and I'll judge myself harshly for doing things that don't seem optimal. On the other hand, it's almost like I relax too much when I take free time "mischeviously"--many of the tasks I commit myself to don't do much to uplift my mood in the long term, even if they're sort of fun while I'm doing them, because the tasks that would uplift my mood more in the long term seem like they would take too much effort.

I wonder if there's a middle ground. In a way I think I don't even really know what sorts of activities I find truly "relaxing" or viscerally satisfying--it's like I know how to satisfy my superego or my id but not my whole self. I generally have the sense that when I have free time, I s

There are two things I'd like to do right now on an "executive" level, shower and study Backbone.js, that I haven't done yet even though I've been intending to for a few hours. I wonder why these sorts of things happen.

There is a lot of variation in the degree to which I respond to my own "executive" desires. Before Wednesday, when I started working for Virginia, I was very doggedly doing work on Backbone, to the point that I wasn't seeing my friends much or anything. Now I guess perhaps I'm out of the swing a bit, since I was working for Virginia a lot and didn't do any programming study for the past few days. I socialized on Saturday, and worked on music and read Zizek all of Sunday.  Today I've mostly read Wikipedia articles on animals and more Zizek.

Reading Zizek or working on music feels productive to me, which is probably part of what contributes to this. Right now, I feel like studying Backbone is a sort of "base" activity compared with either of those, even though I also feel it would be of great benefit to me. I think part of the dynamic is that I don't have much of an emotional attachment to making moneyââI like the idea of having my own place and so on, but the indirectness of those benefits makes them harder to care about (what I'm working towards is a full-time job, which presumably will then net me benefits of increased independence and so on, instead of my studying work being a direct link to those benefits). Also, the desirable benefits in themselves are less important to me than the ability to study and produce art and so on which I already have in this position. The other side of the worth of studying Backbone, the ability to make art and artistic tools, varies in desirability depending on where my artistic interests lie. Right now, I'm really engaged in a music project that doesn't require any programming knowledge thus far, so I'm more interested in working on that and studying electronic music production techniques and so on.

The only reason I would rather be working on Backbone than music is temporal. I presumably can work on music wheneverââit would be just as well to do it in the evenings after I had gotten work than now.

I think I would probably still study programming because of my personal interest in it and my visions of projects that require it. I don't think I would do it as quickly. My default tendency thus far in my life seems to be to jump around from project to project week by week; I do finish things, but often not in a direct beginning-to-end fashion. Rather, I'll do a third of a project, move to something else, do some pure research for a while, come back and do another third of that project, maybe go on to finish it or maybe abandon it, etc. My enthusiasm for anything as specific as a single project waxes and wanes with the days and weeks.

Sometimes I think this is very problematic. I think of Sandi Metz's talk on the value of grit and perserverance, and I wonder if I would generally get more I cared about finished if I picked a single goal at a time and pursued it directly to its conclusion. It's possible that I would generally be happier.

Sometimes I think it's perfectly fine, also. I like leapfrogging between topics; it's uncomfortable to work on something you don't feel very invested in at the moment. Sandi Metz describes grittiness in a way as the ability to keep working on a project even when it's uncomfortable; clearly that perserverance is gained by a desire to endure that discomfort and press on. The discomfort doesn't vanish, and I can keep myself constantly comfortable by moving around. If I didn't ever finish anything, this would seem like a tremendous, life-misderecting vice, but I finish projects regularly.

So, the cost-benefit picture gets complicated. In the past, when I've tried to doggedly pursue one project to its conclusion and push everything else to the margins, I've suffered pretty deeply, to the point of crying multiple times a day, frequent suicidal ideation, depression, etc., unless it was a short-term project. This is something I understandably want to avoid if I can. On the other hand, I derive some of the highest peaks of happiness I can feel from the completion of work I deeply care about, and if I was able to access those feelings more often, I might be more happy in general. My experience points to both immense costs and immense benefits, potentially, which adds up to feelings of ambivalence when I consider the topic.

Of course, in theory it doesn't have to be so all-or-nothing. It is possible that I could work on my "executive" goals for a "reasonable" amount of time on a given day and then use the rest of the day to pursue my more "visceral" goals. In practice, it has seemed thus far in my life that that is even less a part of my own proclivities than pursuing a single project continuously for the long haul. If it's difficult for me to sustain a continuous commitment to a project over the course of several weeks or more, it's wildly difficult for me to work intentionally on a number of different projects during a single day. I perceive each day as being "about" something, as having an overarching topic and/or goal. Developing the ability to "balance" my days in this manner would probably be beneficial, but such behavior is unprecedented in me, whereas I have worked on long-term projects continuously although it was very hard. I have some hope of learning to sustain daily work on a project in the long-term reliably, and I've noticed improvements in my ability to do that over time. I have less hope, at least right now, of acquiring the ability to switch tracks hour-by-hour reliably; I might get to a point where it seems more accessible but at the moment it seems very daunting and far away.

Soââwhat should I do right now? There's a compelling argument that I should shower, because I'll feel more immediately comfortable, and then study Backbone, because it's a more urgent goal than working on music, studying Zizek, etc. I might feel happy in the moment working on non-Backbone projects, but there will always be a net detractor from my happiness as long as I haven't finished my present course of programming study, and it will get more intense as time goes on. I'll be very happy when I finish my music project, because I love the music I'm producing, but there's not much reason to think that the happiness I'll reap will diminish with time, so that I could claim it whenever it makes the most sense to do so in terms of what else is going on in my life. The only reason I haven't already done these things today is, I think, because I doubt I'll be as pleased in the moment studying Backbone and the long-term cost-benefit picture only slightly bends towards the benefits of doing that study.

I think I will try to grit my teeth and shower and then do Backbone work. I'm close to finishing my whole Javascript study program and then I will be able to do work on my projects which will probably be more fun. I also can test my suspicions about how I'll get more ultimately out of finishing my Backbone work and such and /then/ doing music work and the like than I will if I spend more energy than not on doing music right now. To know whether I'm right or wrong about that will be instructive for the future.

After a lot of things I don't quite rememberâsomething about a birthday party and life in a mid-sized Texas townâI'm watching an action-adventure-Indiana-Jones-type movie starring a young woman and her child nephew. The woman wears a black special-ops suit with lots of equipment and climbs around in dangerous ruins and temples, and her nephew tags along and helps.

After watching for a while, eventually I am the woman in the movie. I'm trying to climb a huge cliff that's covered in vines and strange runes. My nephew is curled up in a ball hiding behind a rock on the ground. There are spiders around that frighten him. I'm not afraid of them and brush them away as I start to climbâbut then a huge spider comes up behind me and sinks its teeth into my neck!

***

I wake up. The corner of one of the pillows of my bed is jammed into the back of my neck. :P I fall back asleep quickly.

***

The dream sort of picks up back in the mid-size Texas town. Some of my friends on Twitter are coming to visit, but they're only going to be in town for a very short time, and the exact moments they'll be available are unpredictable. I want to make an Indian curry for them, and am strategizing with one of my housemates (a DC, a small-framed girl around my age with round wireframe glasses and short hair) about the best way to do this. Meanwhile, I'm furiously texting back and forth with my Twitter friends so we can all co-ordinate.

The Texas Department of Agriculture also plays some roleâI think maybe I'm trying to obtain vegetables from them for the curry. An organization called NOFR or something is also involved.

I was an investigator of some sort in a small-ish (Eugene-sized) town.

There was a lot of open space and the scenery was somewhere between

Central Texas and Oregon. I spent much of my time driving and cars

played a large role in my thought process. Mom and Zachary featured

prominently. I went to at least one party. There was maybe some sort

of pattern involving semi-human creatures, maybe of a rather monstrous

sort?

There was a lot more to this dream, but right now this is all I can remember. If more of it comes back to me I'll add it in.

I'm in Virginia, with my father and two friends (Zachary and a DC, a young woman around my age). We've been driving all over the country in pursuit of some sort of long-term goal. I have my own car, as does my dad, but my two friends are driving together.

At one point, we're in my old elementary school (which is located in Texas in WL). We go there after hours, when all the children are gone, and watch a film. We have some sort of strategic discussion as well.

We have to leave in something of a hurry. Even though it's a bit dawdle-y, I know that the "Holy Grail" is located on a hill near the school, and when we all go to leave I set the GPS on my phone to guide me there.

I drive for a few minutes following the GPS and realize it's directing off the road and up a big hill. The hil curves around into a rocky overhang. I realize I've arrived, so I stop the car and get out. There's a chintzy-looking "chalice" made out of gold-colored disco-ball-type material. This is the "Holy Grail", which I'm pleased in a lighthearted way to have found. I take pictures of it and text them to my two friends. They tell me I'm being silly and that I should get going, since they're already twenty minutes down the road. I take the "Holy Grail" with me back to the car and genuinely set off on the next leg of our trip.

I'm living in a very small town (~3000 people) somewhere in the northern U.S. I live alone, but my friends Mike and Katy and some of their friends live in a house across town, which is very near by.

I picked a house closer to the center of town when we moved there, because I figured my friends and I would end up hanging out at the bars and restaurants and so on there. As it happens, we end up hanging out most often at a coffee shop/bar near Mike and Katy's, even though they live on the outskirts of town. Thinking about this, I reflect on how unpredictable human social patterns in a given environment can be.

At the very end of the dream, I'm walking through a field with Katy. We're talking about whether large baby ducks would hover in the air or fall if you dropped them from a helicopter.

As I start to wake up, and I'm in a sort of half-dreaming hypnopompic state, I make a game out of being many stories up in the sky and swinging around on huge ropes that stretch up into the heavens.I grab a rope and fall towards the Earth rapidly, but then swing back upwards, let go, grab another rope, twist around, and do it again. It's really fun, like being on a rollercoaster.

A small group of foxes gathered on the edge of the woods at three in the afternoon. They were there because they had a shared hobby: they liked to go into town together and people-watch. 

  It was a spring day and the wind made a sound in the grass that was like iced tea. The air smelled like cold rocks and distant wildfowers. There were no clouds.

  The foxes stood around in a rough line together looking out through the trees onto a sidewalk. One of them liked to tussle and had a small piece of her ear missing. Another liked cicadas best out of all foods. A third had a tic in which she pawed at the ground, which she did nervously as she watched the dark forms of cars gliding by through the branches.

  "Where do you all want to go first?" said another, who loved to sleep.

  "I've never been to see the park," said the fox with the pawing tic.

  "Yyyyeahh," said the tussle-liking fox, "I don't think you're missing much."

  "Yeah, it's sort of dull," said the fox with cicadas as a favorite food. "Sometimes there isn't even anybody there."

  "I think that's interesting, though." said the pawing fox. "Human spaces have a neat atmosphere when there aren't any people there."

  "What do you mean?" said the sleep-loving fox.

  "Um," said pawing fox. "Well--if there are things that move, you get to see how they move when there's no one around to move them or disturb them or anything like that." She paused in thought. "Like a swing when the wind is blowing it, or a candy wrapper moving along the ground. You can hear the sounds they make clearly, too, since nothing else is in the way."

  "Maybe we /should/ go to the park then," said sleep fox. "There are a lot of swings there all in a row. They're different from the ones people keep in their yards, too."

  "Wow, that sounds awesome!" said Pawing Fox.

  "Okay, I guess we can go to the park," said Tussle Fox. "I was just there last week is all."

  "Well Pawing wasn't here last week" said Sleep.

  "Yeah, I'm okay with going to the park, it's okay," said Cicadas.

  "Yeah, yeah, it's fine, I said it's okay if we go," said Tussle.

  Sleep ran up close to the edge of the sidewalk.

  She whispered back to the group, "There's not many people around. No one nearby." She turned around and looked out onto the sidewalk again, then turned back to the group. "I think we can safely move at about three trees back if we keep fairly quiet." She ambled softly off to the right, and the other foxes followed her.

  They heard a person running up sidewalk behind them. Soon the person passed them by and they got a look at its back. It looked like a tall, thin male, with hair the color of dead grass and skin like snow at the beginning of the sunset. He ran down the sidewalk, the blue mats around his legs flapping in the wind.

  "I wonder why he's moving quickly like that," said Cicadas. "Those aren't normal running-person clothes, right?" 

  "No, I don't think the normal running-people ever wear long mats around their legs like that," said Sleep. "Usually they don't have much clothing on at all and they have little things on threads stuck in their ears."

  "They're such wacky creatures," said Cicadas, as the person ran off into the distance.

  "That one wasn't moving quite like they do, either," said Sleep. "He was moving sort of chaotically."

  "I wonder if he was okay. Maybe he was sick," said Cicadas.

  "Yeah, I'll bet he won't last long," said Tussle.

A SPRING RESIDENCE

<intimate flower interaction>

At first there was only water, and this water was called the sea.

For ages there was only the sea. Then the sea grew dense and formed an egg, and out of the egg hatched a snake called Varnas. Varnas gave birth to a whale called Mell.

Mell broke the surface of the sea with a great leap, and the air and the sky formed. Glittering droplets of sea-water fell from Mell's tail and hung in the sky forever, and these were called stars. This was the beginning of the universe.

After many years a plethora of creatures came out from the sea onto the land, which had been barren. In this way all the land became full with life just as the sea was.

One of these creatures found a mirror in a forest and swallowed it. Afterwards this creature was called a person. This person multiplied into many people which all had a mirror inside, and they covered the world. The places were they gathered in large numbers were called cities. One of these people, in one of the cities, was called Harriet. 

As long as I can remember, I've had a strange relationship with leopardness.

When I was a very young calf, my parents put me in a pre-school for young animals. Being very progressive, they enrolled me in an interspecies school, and so I played with the young of many different animals. Of course, this was true of everyone in the school to some degree, but I found myself drawn to a small group of leopards in particular. We became fast friends and soon I was playing with them every day. Sometimes the teachers would need to split us up into groups for an activity, and often they would do this by species, which was my first gentle exposure to a pattern that was to deeply trouble me. I would be separated from my leopard friends and put in a group of elephants where I knew no one well, and had to cobble together satisfying social interaction from vague acquiantences.

I attended this school regularly for a few years and over time picked up a lot from my leopard friends. I learned the songs of leopard cubs, their games, the activities they like, their ways of solving disputes. Sometimes they would lend me some of their clothes if I took an interest, and I must have looked strange to the teachers, an elephant dressed in leopard hat and stockings or something like that, but we were all very young and thought nothing of it. If this did bother the teachers, they gave no sign, and if my parents noticed my movements towards leopardness they said nothing about it either.

Predictably, the real trouble began when I first entered the public schools. Suddenly, I was surrounded by elephants only, day-to-day, and my innocent gravitations towards the ways of leopards became, of course, a great mark against me in the eyes of my fellow students.

We have done much to ease speciesist prejudice in our society but I hope you will agree that we have a long way to go. This story should not come to you as much of a surprise. In polite, liberal circles, open acknowledgement of such prejudice is heavily frowned upon, but outside such circles, it can openly persist, and even within them it may persist covertly. Children, who are very sensitive to the things the adults around them try to hide, often openly embrace the worse parts of the nature of the adults around them, those parts that still live in those adults but are actively supressed by them.

If you are not an elephant or a leopard, you may not know that prejudice against leopards is particularly common amongst elephants. Our herbivourosness tends to foster an instinctive dislike of most predators, especially pure carnivores like big cats, but leopards get it worst than most, I think. Although I grew up a long way from Africa, we share an ancestral environment, so perhaps this dislike stretches into the misty past. In any case, there is a pervasive image of leopards as conniving, selfish, and physically weak. I think lions are better-liked because they live in groups, which we can relate to, and we appreciate the great size and power of tigers even though they are individualists. All such species suffer amongst elephants and I don't want to say that leopards always have it worse. I think there are a lot of elephants who have never thought much about tigers, though, who could go on and on about how frustrating, wicked, and petty leopards are.

Fortunately, it doesn't seem to me like this prejducice extends as far in the opposite direction, although of course I don't have as much experience. I can find leopards now and again that say very cruel things about elephants, but often it seems to me like a logical reaction towards a species that has openly and covertly oppressed them their whole lives. In areas where leopards predominate, I've heard that an elephant can have some trouble, but I think that if we begin treating leopards with respect and kindness this would no longer be the case. It may be a very old pattern, but its structure indicates to me that when it began, we fired first. 

In any case, my peers in elementary school seized on my leopardishness with rabid aggression. More than once every day, I would do something that carelessly betrayed my leopard habits--the way I sat, the things I made, my struggles with activities common to elephant children that I hadn't been much exposed to. Inevitably, the other calves would scream and holler that I was acting like a /leopoard/, of all things, and would do anything from laugh at me to physically attack me. I had a single friend, but she was fair-weather--she had a larger group that she liked to hang out with and often would pick them over me. I asked her if I could join them one day and she told me that I should stay away because they hated me. I thought of telling her that I thought it was wrong for her to be friends with me and elephants like that, but if she had abandoned me I would have been a complete pariah.

I soon internalized the idea that being anything like a leopard was shameful; what first struck me as completely alien now took on the quality of an unchallengeable law. I turned my head if I saw toys for leopards in a store, I changed the channel if any shows with a leopard protaganist came on, and although I still saw some of my leopard friends from pre-school now and again I did my best to keep my friendship with any of them a secret. I have fond memories of birthday from this time in my life--having no close friends at school, I would have the leopard friends I was still in touch with over to celebrate, and for an afternoon I would be able to revel in the now-forbidden pleasure of spending time in a group in which I could act by instinct and be understood.

As time went on, I got better at supressing the leopardish parts of myself and bringing out the elephantine parts in their place. Even to this day there are aspects of mainstream elephant behavior that I struggle to even understand, let alone enact, but through careful study and practice I was able to present a comprehendably elephantine persona. Through years of mocking and derision, I learned which parts of myself the other elephants saw as leapordish, and used that understanding to bury those parts. As I did this, my peers at school accepted me more and more, until eventually I had a large circle of friends and felt rather popular.

Sadly, in a way, my sense of joy and comfort at this was short-lived. It wasn't long until I started on the long road of adolescence. The further I went along that road and started to consider the wider world and my place in it from a more adult perspective, the more my buried sense of leopardness tried to claw its way to the surface. I would often wake with a jolt of fear from dreams where I looked in a mirror or a puddle and realized I was a leopard. I felt undeniably drawn to the media and objects made for leopards that I had previously avoided with a religious sense of prohibition. Soon I began to perceive myself as having two selves: the elephant self, which was "me," and the leopard self, which begged, pleaded, demanded to become me.

Discovery

Discover the structure your piece needs. Don't design it beforehand.

Many books on writing tell you to write your first draft with wild abandon and be completely willing to destroy it later. This is to encourage you to discover your piece as you go and it's applicable to all artistic media, not just literature. 

When you first start on a piece, you may have a very strong idea of what the whole piece will be like when it's done, or you might have no clue. 

If you have that strong idea, use it to get yourself started--make your first moves with an eye towards that idea. However, once you've got even the tiniest smidgen of something, let it tell you where to go next. Take your eyes off of your grand idea. The odds are quite high that after you've been working for a while, a much grander idea will emerge that you will miss if you stay attached to your initial one.

If you have no idea, work on impulse. Draw a line that looks pretty to you, play a few random notes, write down a scrap of dialogue you just heard someone in the other room say. Then take a look at what you just made and think about something that might be nice to go with it. If something comes to you, go with that and just keep doing that over and over. If what you made doesn't suggest anything to do, do something else on impulse next to it. Don't think about the first thing you made at all. Then look at them together and see if they suggest something to you. If not, make a third thing on impulse. Eventually, something will emerge to you that you can pursue.

Sooner or later you will feel like you're done. Then you can stop, take a step back, and start thinking about how you could arrange the things you have.

Editing

Now you're free to edit. Really, I think art is mostly editing. In a certain sense, all of art is editing--when you're making your first pass, you're editing raw reality.

Despite this, I was confused about editing for years. I had been told over and over of the virtues of careful editing, and had seen lots of proof of its importance--painters who did dozens of studies for a single painting and made many different versions of it before they decided on one, writers who worked on one short poem for months, composers who revised a piece for decades. Sometimes these pieces were nothing much, if the artist was doing all that editing just because they felt that it was proper to edit, but often they were of thrilling and daunting brilliance. When I made a piece, though, it always looked pretty good to me on first pass. I'd usually go through and touch up a little and then call it done. At the same time, I was mystified by what those brilliant artists did to produce such incredible work.

I'm not advocating overediting. Sometimes I hear someone boasting about revising a piece fifty times, as if that alone makes them an amazing artist. Often when I look at the work they produced it seems pretty boring to me. So, I don't think there's any reason to revise a piece just for the sake of it, or because you heard that brilliant and famous so-and-so worked on such-and-such a classic piece for twenty years. Some pieces really need this to be awesome. Other pieces are done very quickly. I'm sure you've also come across an incredible piece only to discover that the artist who made it dashed it off in an hour.

Your work will tell you what it needs.

Once you get the feeling that you're done or even just vaguely okay with your first pass, start to question each of its components to see what they say about themselves. Ask them what they're doing and why. If they don't give you an answer to both questions, tell them to leave. Be open and patient, though--it might take them a while to figure it out. That's fine.

Once you've got a set of components and you know what they're doing and why, see if they can tell you what they're all doing together. They might know right away. If so, great. If not, you might have to figure it out for them. Take a look at what each one of them is doing and think about how that interacts with what the others are doing. Maybe two of them are doing things that would be nice right next to each other. Try getting them to stand together. Perhaps they look good that way. Maybe one of them seems to be off in their own world. Have them stand over to the side for now--they might have a good place to be later, but it might also turn out that they should be a part of a different group that has more in common with them.

You might think of a number of things they could all do together that might work well. Set them up so they're doing one of them, take a picture so you remember how it looks, and then have them do another. Look at all the pictures and see if there's one you like best. If so, go with that one. Maybe you like a few or even all of them equally. If so, think about making a suite! Start with one, polish it until it's finished, and then move on to the next. If all the pieces are still equally good to you, treat them all as components in a larger piece and start over. Hopefully when you're finished you'll have a nice suite of pieces that all work well independently and work even better in tandem.

You might realize, once you get them all to do something together, that some of them aren't working very hard at playing their role. Take them aside and work with them until they're doing a stellar job. Put them back with their teammates and see if everything is improved. Maybe they're doing what they need to do just right as it is; maybe they're doing something that would be stellar in a different piece but isn't quite right here. If so, take them aside again and have them try it a different way that's more appropriate for the overall goal of the piece.

Once you've worked with each of them in this way, take a look at the whole piece again, think about its overall goal, and ask yourself if each of the components is still doing a stellar job. It might be that one of them started doing something that messed one of the other ones up. One or both of them will probably need to change.

As you do all of this, keep asking yourself those questions about the components from the last chapter. At any stage of the process, you might realize that one of the components should really be three, or that two components that started at opposite ends of the piece should be in a group together, or any such thing like that. You'll probably group and ungroup and combine and uncombine various components many times. You might take one out, bring it in again later, take it out again, and then bring it in again with some modifications in the final pass. You might even find that two whole pieces that seemed totally different to you when you started should be combined into one, or that a piece you were working on should really be five distinct pieces. Always be open to this kind of re-organizing and experiment vigorously.

Introduction

This book is about making art sing.

We're in a thrilling time right now. Many barriers have been torn down. Artists are largely free to do what they like--for the most part, no one will tell you that you are breaking any rules. This has resulted in a grand plurality of styles in all artistic media. One artist's work may be radically different from another's, even if they are working in very similar areas.

This presents a special challenge to artists, too. All this freedom is daunting. In the past, there were far more conventions that instructed artists in how to design their work. As much as this was a limitation, it was also something of a luxury--you were free from having to design brand new structures and techniques to suit your artwork. Since everyone was working with largely the same conventions, your work was more easily comprehended by others, and if you wanted to deviate from those conventions, it could be clear what you were trying to push forward.

With our new freedom we have acquired new responsibility. In order to make a cohesive piece, we must understand the essence of artistic structure. Gone are the days when we could develop a deep relationship with an existing structure and have that be enough.

Much contemporary art shows the weight of these pressures. Artists frequently make work without considering structure at all; they tie together a number of components they like with the sense that the structure will take care of itself. Unfortunately, it rarely does so as well as the artist could if they really tried, and their work ends up being interesting but not deeply moving. In other cases, artists revert back to old conventions, making work that owes too heavily to the style of past greats, so that you cannot help but think of the giant in whose shadow they are standing and how dwarfed by that giant they are. This work is not even interesting, generally.

I think that to make truly beautiful art, we must learn how to assemble beautiful parts into a beautiful whole that suits them. We are free to structure our art in a way that more precisely fits it than ever before. To do this, we must not shy away from the challenge of creating that structure. We must revel in the playful joy of that challenge with all the energy we put into making beautiful components. In this way, the promise of making great art is held out to us.

What is structure?

Structure is the webbing that ties the components of a piece together. In art that takes place over time, like literature, music, theater, and film, it has to do with the order the parts of the piece go in and how they relate to one another. In art that stays still, like painting, sculpture, and architecture, it has to do with how the parts of the piece are arranged together in space. In all cases, it's about how the parts relate to one another--where they share material, where they are unique in the piece, and how they change the effect that all the other pieces have.

You may have a set of components that are all transcendentally beautiful, but if you arrange them together randomly they're unlikely to seem as beautiful as they did when they were all on their own. There's some way you can arrange them that will accentuate their beauty instead, and if you figure out what it is you will discover that those components are more beautiful than you ever imagined before.

Of course, you might also discover that some of them are less beautiful than you thought, or that they would really be more beautiful in an arrangement with some other components. This is a wonderful thing to discover. You can then remove those components to use in some other piece, and they will give the ones that belong room to breathe properly.

You might also discover that those components that belong are about three-quarters as beautiful as they might be if you changed them some so they interacted with each other more fluently. This will make both the individual components and the piece as a whole far more beautiful than it would have been if you hadn't discovered this.

Maybe at this moment you are wondering what I mean by "components". You might have the sense that it's hard to figure out what the components are. Consider a photo of a dog lying on the front lawn of a house with the street showing in the bottom of the photo. Are the lawn and the street separate components, or are they one thing, the ground? Should they be grouped together with the sky, as composing the landscape? If so, should the house be included too, or is it not a part of the landscape? Maybe the lawn should be grouped with the house as a unit instead? Should the dog be included, then?

There's no right answer to these questions. Instead, they present choices. You are free to decide what you think the correct answer is to any of them, and often it's a number of things at once--for instance, if you decide that the lawn, the street, and the sky should comprise the background landscape, you might want to take the photo in a way that highlights the dog and the house. This will create a connection between the dog and the house that you should want to create for some reason, should you make that decision. If you decide that the lawn is seperate from the street, you might decide that there's no reason to have the street in the photo at all. That will draw more attention to what remains in the photo, which you should have a reason for doing.

These are vital questions to ask. You can decide what is and isn't a component, and what components comprise a group together, and perhaps what groups all go under a certain umbrella, and so on. In fact, I think you have to do this if you want to structure your piece; otherwise, you won't really know what you're working with.

Of course, you don't have to make one decision and stick with it. You are free to try treating two things as one thing, then try treating them as separate but closely related things, and then try treating them as two totally distinct things, and see how your piece changes as you do this. This sort of experimentation is almost always necessary to find a good structure, I think, because it's very hard to know what everything should be in advance.

[quote="moogle"]Couldn't resist peeking and there's nothing to be embarrassed about :-)[/quote]

Awwww thanks! |) I think it's just a personal thingâyou know, it can be hard sometimes to go back at look at things you wrote when you were in your early teens and so on. I imagine that it wouldn't necessarily trigger the same feelings in someone else. 

[b]Dec. 8th[/b]

[ND]This dream took place in two main environments: a giant, many-roomed house in the style of a suburban American [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMansion]McMansion[/url], and a massive, thick pine forest adjacent to it. I spent the whole dream with two DCs, a man and a woman in their late 20s, who were my close friends in the dream.

I think the beginning of the dream took place mostly in the house, but my recall of that part is somewhat spotty. I remember that there were lots of other people in the house aside from the three of us, and that I had my own room I was staying in that I slept in several times. The social atmosphere in the house was like a big group vacation; everyone in the house was around my age.

My friends and I kept going out into the woodsâwe were really interested in what was happening there, moreso than we were in the goings-on in the house. The woods were inhabited by a huge colony of ants, with countless trails and a number of huge mounds at various places. We first got an inkling of this when we found one of their mounds in a clearingâit was like a small hill you could walk around on! It and the clearing were completely covered with ants, but luckily they didn't crawl on us or bother us or anything, so we walked around for a while and examined them and their space with great interest. We were somewhat in awe. We had noticed their trails while walking around the woods and this was our first inkling that they were there in such numbers. Interestingly, we also found a smaller but still very large mound that some black beetles were living in in the same clearing.

A while after that, still hiking around in the forest, we found a small one-room cottage. It was empty, but had a few beds, a bathroom, and an endtable that was covered in papers. Examining the papers, we realized that they were the results of someone else's study of the ants, with descriptions of their comings-and-goings and speculations on how long they had been there, the finer points of their behavior, etc. One of the papers had a hand-drawn map with the large anthill we had found as well as an even larger one elsewhere in the forest! The map noted the large beetle mound we'd seen in the clearing and pointed out that the even larger anthill was just inhabited by the ants.

We started using the cottage as a base to eat and sleep in and stayed in the woods for several days searching for the larger anthill. Eventually, we found it, and it was so large that it actually took some climbing to get around on it! As before, the ants didn't bother us so we could move around as we pleased. We were deeply intrigued and spent a long time looking around and talking about what their larger relationship to the forest might be.

Eventually, we made our way back to the big house and holed up in a tiny room above the garage. There was a small television there. We watched a movie on it that was an action-thriller about a woman who comes into conflict with a group of eco-terrorists. The eco-terrorists were a strange bunch, thoughâthey were after the protaganist because she let animals do as they pleased, and they thought the things she allowed animals to do harmed the environment. They thought that animals should be tightly controlled or even killed to prevent them from harming the Earth. :????: It was a tense film with a lot of guns and shouting and helicopters and people wearing black clothes and so on.

We then went back into the main house. I went upstairs to use the bathroom and saw myself in the mirror; I had a neat gender hodge-podge look going on. I was wearing heavy eye makeup and pink-lavender lipstick, along with a goatee that went around my mouth. My hair was straight, medium-length, and sticking out like I'd put hairspray in it. It had pale blue, purple, pink, and silver highlights and a lot of glitter. I was wearing an outfit similar to a [url=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1A0LIAcCILM/TPQ1GVsDP7I/AAAAAAAAASs/ykvTqJJtk18/s1600/vuelta+castella.JPG]torero[/url] but with low-waisted paints and no dress shirt or tie, so that my midriff showed. The shape of my face and body were completely androgynous. Very glam :flower:

I washed my hands and face in the sink and then my alarm went off.[/ND]

Wheee, I'm starting a new dream journal! A long time ago, I used to maintain a journal on Sea Life. A bit later, in 2006, I made an [url=http://www.ld4all.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=246452&highlight=#246452]attempt[/url] at starting a journal here that never really got off the ground, but has a few dreams in it from my early-to-mid teens.

The main thing that prompted me to return to this site is that I've been having lots of a strange sort of LD, in an unusual way for me. For about the past month or two or so, I've been having short, very minimal LDs whenever I've gone to bed without being tired enough. Usually they've been via WILD, often on accident. Along with these dreams has come better dream recall in general than I've had for a while, and together they've prompted me to think about dreams a lot more than I have been for the past few years.

These beinning-of-thenight WILDs have strange properties compared to my normal dreams, lucid or otherwise. They're usually in black-and-white, take place in my bedroom or sometimes in an empty room in another house, and generally don't feature any DCs. They tend to be rather low in qualityâhighly unstable, short in duration, not particularly vivid, and not particularly in-control. Still, they've been so odd that I've rather enjoyed them, although they usually portend a period of insomnia.

I haven't been keeping close track of them and I've forgotten the details of many, but here's an example:

[b]A few weeks ago[/b]

[LD]I'm lying in bed with my eyes closed, but I don't feel very tired. I give up on sleeping, open my eyes, and roll onto my back. Looking around, I realize that I'm in a huge utility/laundry room in a house I don't live in, so I must've fallen asleep!

Right away, I lift off of my bed into the air and hover near the ceiling. The room I'm in is mostly emptyâthere are some cabinets off to the right, and some drawers and cabinets covering the wall in front of me with a sink set-in. It reminds me of a room used to wash clothes and store linens in a daycare or small primary school.

I float across the room to the sink, deciding that I want to drink some water. I turn on the tap and gather some water in my cupped hands. When I bring them to my face, it's as if the water isn't there; I can see it, but if I try to drink it, it's like it's just air. I pour the only-visual water in my hands down the sink and try to drink straight from the tap, which causes me to wake up.[/LD]

This one was memorable to me because it was more complex than most of them. Generally, when they happen, I'm lying in bed trying to fall asleep and an image begins to materialize that looks more-or-less like what I would see if my eyes were open. At first, I wonder if I'm starting to dream or if I've just opened my eyes without noticing. If the image fully comes together, I'll look around at my room and usually notice subtle differences about it that make me confident that I'm dreaming. Then I'll rummage around my "room" for a few moments before waking up.

I imagine the properties of these dreams come from them being at the very beginning of my sleep, when REM cycles are very short and lacking depth, or from being more like naps than a real period of sleep. Generally, when I wake up from them, I don't feel very tired, and it takes me an hour or two to properly fall asleep for the night. Very strange, in any case!

I just now read your story in /Concisely/ and I thought it was /awesome/! I rarely read any contemporary fiction that I like at all. I'm glad you took the trouble to write it. Stories that deftly make "hideous" sorts of people private and empathetic are always wonderful I think. Often it seems to me like those stories do a far better job of exposing the feelings at the very heart of human life than stories about more placid people (/Notes from Underground/?). Everybody knows what it's like to "think wrong" in some fashion but of course almost no one wants to ever reveal that or even become conscious of feeling that way when it happens.

What was your dream about? Have you had any notable dreams more recently?

What led you to occupational therapy? That seems interesting! i think Southern culture is catchy, particularly the food and music which are such big aspects. The lack of public transportation is definitely awful though and a good library is one of the best things (here UT has a fantastic giant library but it's not a very pleasant building to be in, it's all like unadorned glass and plastic and spaces made from white boxes and whatnot--I miss the Northeastern libraries that were built in the late 1800s). 

The Fairgrounds is still an image I come back to very often. That and standing on Lake Mansfield frozen over in winter. Between those images and trees in flower I think everything beautiful is probably contained at heart.

Certain types of art music, bebop, and DJ Screw's hip hop are the most ideal sorts of music for that that I've found--music that you can pay close attention to and enjoy deeply that way but also have in the background of your thought and enjoy deeply that way too for sure. Those sorts of art music are probably what I go to most often in those situations and depending on the specific atmosphere I feel in the mood for I typically go to Josquin, Bach fugues, Beethoven symphonies, Brahms symphonies, early Schoenberg, anything by Webern, and Steve Reich's /Piano Phase/ or /Music for 18 Musicians/. With bebop and DJ Screw I think pretty much anything good goes but as I said I go to art music most often so if I went to those other two as often I might have more specific opinions. I can put together a collection of these for you if you want, along with that playlist of music that disintegrates from something else more basic or chaotic into itself despite itself if you still want that after all this time.

I found that if you start this video at 1/3 of the normal volume and then start "Pancho and Lefty" when the yellow banner appears, they have a neat interaction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIqLJmlQQNM

I've dug up the letters I'd half-written to you over the last few years but I feel embarrassed by all of them. I seem to be sort of cursed with a constant distaste as my life progresses for whomever I was a year or two ago. I'm not really sure what to do with those sorts of feelings generally aside from feel unhappy about them from time to time, which doesn't seem ideal but maybe is the best I or anyone can do.

I'm not really sure what to say or think about the quality of my life these days--"quality" both in terms of goodness/badness and in terms of the general atmosphere. The good parts seem less good and the bad parts seem less bad, and I'm not pleased with that but nearly everything I've tried to improve that dynamic has just damped the goodness and amplified the badness, with the exception of visiting Chicago where I was probably the happiest I've been since 2008-9 for the two weeks I was there. From a few months after graduation to last October I worked as a data center technician in Austin which was one of the most hideous universes I've ever entered (I have all sorts of funnyawful stories that probably are best told in person). I finally escaped and then moved to Eugene, Oregon, which was also pretty hideous in a different set of ways (the data center was inhuman and static in culture and Eugene was passive-agressive and profane in culture although the natural environment was overwhelmingly fantastic there). Now I'm in Austin again and trying to find a pattern through which I can consistently get work that I can stand and have enough space in my life to make art all the time. 

I don't think I want to stay here permanently. I've realized that I don't really like medium-sized cities--I seem to like either huge cities or completely rural areas. In large cities I love all the culture I can access in physical space, and in rural areas I love the profusion of plants-and-wild-animals sorts of spaces and the lack of people. Cities of medium size don't have enough interesting culture or plants and wild animals to justify the number of people you have to be nearby all the time it seems. On the bright side there are a couple of people here who're really good to work with-I'm working on a set of pieces with a visual artist in town (text is mine, visuals are hers):

but then again in another way

all of life's just lemonadeâ

plants take energy from the sun

and then herbivores eat them

and then carnivores eat them

and then bigger carnivores eat them tooâ

that's like just what you've got to doâ

life is rare in the universeâ

resources are scarce here on earthâ

think of all the animals that have ever died from thirstâ

287,000 women a year die from giving birthâ

and like all we really want is to exist in a blissful timelesness

where it's just the people we love and our ideas endlessly together

where like heaven is a place where nothing ever happens, forever

is life worth living?

it's so hard to say

you can never confidently answer 'till the

very end of your days

JUST OUT OF REACH

it was a beautiful night

the frost sparkled like tears

in the small angles of the tree branches

I was a fox looking up on the top of a hill

and you were just out of reach

just out of reach over in the next town

in your tall cold house

watching films by yourself

black-and-white geese then fly overhead

with somewhere to go in mind

The ratio of happiness and sadness

Laugh a little sad to forget to remember

Late dawn rays enter my soul

I bet with my heart I will be happy tomorrow

That ratio in favor of tears

THE SEA'S FARAWAY CRIES

in the sea's

faraway cries:

my forever-

alibi

/A winter afternoon/

  Am I ever as pretty as the stars?

  the glittering snow?

  the frozen flowers?

  Do we ever all look good together?

  [stars]

  The snow was falling all around and it was so beautiful

  all around on all the people's drab outfits over and over

  there was a group of tulips waiting to bloom by the roadside

  I wore an unflattering poofy jacket and big green rubber boots

  [snowflakes]

  One day I feel like a glowing crane

  the next like a sweaty sow

  It's so easy to forget your way

  so you feel that life is wrong

WOULD I BE PERMITTED

can I ever escape myself?

where am I

within my own castle?

do the guards there know my name?

would I be permitted 

out of doors?

Sea Tangle (from http://yume.vn/news/sang-tac/tho)

as tide wait

that can not be heard again singing silver waves

White walked bout loss

just hand still rubbing up hard marble dream

wait incarnations

night very qunh

Marine faces lack a thrill out

I bring laughter show years old

What people are happy about that place?

qunh very fragrant

inspired hand dunes on the eyes

cover their lips look incredulous flock of seagulls throw, you

stay here, where'm already sad?

corner sat the old shop sometimes lie just to find the routine that

is not only old songs that you click on his lap shallow sea

who said people crowded laugh

that star across the ear as shortness of breath several times turned intolerable

Jasmine loves

carelessly scattered, hid home on the night of the deliberate

I step into the story he steals a glance

Novel attacks OAP is thought pat the shape

not far away

because the waves from the shore only a cape holding

night, in the midst of the sea tangle

I dragged her to a corner mused thoughtfully

old letters written to each other now fossilized

How are you?

Oh no, happy as much as pretend voices

cicaaada!

cicaaada!

cicaaada!

cicaaada!

very very very loud

very very very large

cute jade cicada

I love your spent husks

I wish I had a million of them

I know that's a common opinion

you don't seem to care about them

you are my sweetheart

let's lay in bed all day

we could get high and watch old russian films

do you wanna buy a pineapple

you have nice eyes

round and viridian-blue

they make me think of a koi pond

or a shiny robin's egg

I am a whale!

you are a wolf!

life is very strange

it's all sorts of nonsense

you are my sweetheart

let's lay in bed all day

we could get high and watch old russian films

do you wanna buy a pineapple

Attr. have a range from 1-10.

Normalcy -- how normal you come off to others. Someone with high Normalcy registers as close to the mean in their appearance and speech. This is advantageous as people in this world are generally suspicious of others who make an impression on them as unusual, and even those with low Normalcy who tend to dislike "normals" are mostly concerned with a person's mindset and will generally approve of someone who has a regular look and feel if that person expresses opinions they agree with or shares their interests. Note that this only covers the impression someone gives off, not their internal personality--someone can have high Normalcy and entertain bizarre private thoughts that they never give evidence of in public. The average score is 7--the conformist nature of the culture means both that people tend to be close to the mean and that it's possible to cover a large distance going away from it.

Standing -- how respected you are in the community. While Normalcy contributes more heavily to social interaction with strangers, Standing also plays a role, and it becomes the dominant stat once your Standing is established in a social interaction. Someone with high standing is a well-known mover and shaker, like a successful businessperson, politician, or celebrity. Someone with low standing is a nobody--a quiet, reclusive person who engages in activities the community take little notice of or actively dislikes. Someone with average Standing has a healthy circle of friends and is engaged in activities that are unimpressive but generally approved of.

Athleticism -- your health and physical prowess. Someone with high Athleticism is coordinated, strong, has lots of endurance, and rarely gets sick. A very high score implies a professional athlete or someone with an obsessive devotion to fitness. A very low score implies someone who eats poorly and rarely gets out of the house; characters with low Athleticism are likely very thin or very fat.

Guts -- chutzpah. Someone with high Guts does what they want, when they want, and is able to compel those around them to fall in line or stay out of the way. Someone with low Guts is submissive and frightened of authority. A very high score implies an above-the-law type who casually breaks rules and has an easy rapport with those who would enforce them; a very low score implies someone who will see rules in a situation they are afraid to break even when no such rules exist.

Let's examine some character outlines to get an idea of how these states play with one another:

Sabrina Yassin has slightly low Normalcy, high Standing, slightly low Athleticism, and moderately high Guts. She's a middle-aged VP at a local mid-size tech company and has a social circle consisting mostly of other senior-level professionals, especially fellow businesspeople. She was born in the community she lives in and several of her friends she's been close to since high school. Her interests are somewhat unusual--she follows the teachings in the books of a New Age guru and watches mostly Bollywood films--but she only talks about them if someone else brings up an aspect of them first. She's extroverted and generally dismissive of people she instinctively feels are below her. She's naturally healthy but doesn't get much exercise. 

Billy Cai has [average Normalcy (7)], moderate Standing, high Athleticism, and moderate Guts. He's a high school football player who does very well on the field, but has a bland personality and doesn't think about much in depth aside from football. He plays videogames in his free time, likes classic rock music, and doesn't follow politics. His friends are mostly other guys on the football team; he's an established member in his social group but doesn't do much to set its tone, generally following the lead of his most assertive friends.

Norman Williams has [high Normalcy], low Standing, moderate Athleticism, and low Guts. He's middle-aged and lives alone; he's been divorced and has no children. He doesn't work, having an inheritance large enough to live off of. Shy and troubled, he builds electronics as a hobby, watches a lot of television, and drinks heavily when alone.
